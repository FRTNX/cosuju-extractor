The subparagraph further provides that the confession shall be presumed, unless \nthe contrary is proved, to have been freely and voluntarily made by the accused in his or her \nsound and sober senses and without having been unduly influenced to make the confession.  \n\nThe accused were indicted on two counts of murder and one of robbery. At their trial before \nHugo J in the Natal Provincial Division they pleaded not guilty. Two of the accused had \nmade statements before a magistrate which were tendered by the prosecution as admissible \nconfessions. The question arose whether s 217(1)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Act was \ninconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution. Counsel for the defence and the \nprosecution consented in terms of s 101(6) of the Constitution to the trial judge deciding the \nissue. Notwithstanding the consent, Hugo J refrained from deciding on the validity of the \nsection, referring the matter to the Constitutional Court for decision and adjourning the trial \nsine die. The Attorney-General of Natal sought direct access to the Constitutional Court in \nterms of s 100(2) of the Constitution on the grounds that it was in the interests of justice that \na binding decision be given as soon as possible on the validity of s 217(1)(b)(ii).  \n\nThe Court granted the application for direct access.  \n\nThe Court found s 217(1)(b)(ii) to be in violation of s 25(3) of the Constitution (right to a fair \ntrial). It held it to be a longstanding principle of English and South African law of evidence \nthat the prosecution should prove that any confession on which it wished to rely was freely \nand voluntarily made. Section 217(1)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Act places on the \naccused the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that a confession recorded by a \nmagistrate was not free and voluntary. It is not sufficient for the accused merely to raise a \ndoubt. The section therefore creates a legal burden of rebuttal on the accused -- a so-called \n'reverse onus'.  \n\nThe Court considered the common law rule requiring the prosecution to prove that a \nconfession has been freely and voluntarily made to be inherent in the rights specifically \nmentioned in s 25(2), s 25(3)(c) and (d) of the Constitution and forms part of the right to a \nfair trial. These rights are the necessary reinforcement of the principle that the prosecution \nmust prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Reversing the burden of proof \nseriously compromises and undermines these rights. It followed that s 217(1)(b)(ii) violates \nthese provisions.  \n\n1 \n\n\f \n\nThe Court held that the tests of reasonableness, justification and necessity for limitation of \nfundamental rights set out in s 33(1) of the Constitution are not identical, and in applying \neach of them individually one will not always get the same result. But in the present case, it \nwas held, reasonableness, justification and necessity may be looked at and assessed together. \nThe rights interfered with are fundamental to concepts of justice and forensic fairness and \nhave existed in South Africa for over 150 years. A drastic consequence of the alteration to the \nlaw brought about by s 217(1)(b)(ii) is the possibility that an accused may be convicted over \nthe reasonable doubt of the court. It was not shown by the state that it was impossible or \nunduly burdensome for the prosecution to discharge its onus under the common law rule. Nor \nwas it shown that the common law rule caused substantial harm to the administration of \njustice. Even if it were assumed that the reverse onus may in some cases obviate or shorten a \ntrial within a trial on the admissibility of a confession, and released the prosecution from the \ninconvenience of marshalling and calling their witnesses before the accused gave evidence, \nthese advantages do not outweigh and justify the substantial infringement of fundamental \nrights that are the result of the application of the subparagraph. Accordingly s 217(1)(b)(ii) \ndoes not meet the criteria laid down in s 33(1) of the Constitution. It is declared inconsistent \nwith the Constitution and invalid.  \n\nIn the absence of a specific order by the Constitutional Court in the interests of justice and \ngood government giving retrospective effect to a declaration that a law is invalid, s 98(6)(a) \nprovides that a declaration of invalidity shall not invalidate anything done or permitted in \nterms of that law before the coming into effect of the declaration of invalidity. The Court held \nthat the likely result of ordering the declaration of invalidity of s 217(1)(b)(ii) to have full \nretrospective effect, invalidating earlier rulings on admissibility, would be numerous appeals \nwith the possibility of proceedings de novo. In proceedings de novo the necessary evidence \nof voluntariness may no longer be available. The Court considered s 98(6)(a) to be intended \nto ensure that the invalidation of a law existing at the commencement of the Constitution \nshould not ordinarily have retrospective effect, so as to avoid the dislocation and \ninconvenience of undoing transactions, decisions or actions taken under that law. The \nConstitutional Court's power to order otherwise in the interests of justice and good \ngovernment should be exercised circumspectly. In some cases the interests of individuals \nmust be weighed against the interest of avoiding dislocation to the administration of justice \nand the desirability of a smooth transition from the old to the new. The application of the \nsubparagraph may well have caused injustice to accused persons, but the court cannot repair \nall past injustice by a simple stroke of the pen. In the present case, it was held, a proper \nbalance could be struck by invalidating the admission of any confession in reliance on s \n217(1)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Act before the date of the declaration of invalidity of \nthe section, but in respect only of trials begun on or after 27 April 1994 and in which the \nverdict had not been given at the date of the declaration.  \n\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Kentridge AJ and was concurred in by all the \nother members of the Court.  \n\n \n\n2 \n\n\f"}, "judgement_document": {"filename": "judgement-for-case-1.pdf", "file_url": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1995/1.pdf", "file_content": "IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA\n\nIn the matter of :\n\nCASE NO : CCT/5/94\n\nZUMA AND TWO OTHERS\n\nApplicants\n\nand\n\nTHE STATE\n\nRespondent\n\nHEARD ON\n\n23 February 1995\n\nDELIVERED ON\n\n5 April 1995\n\nJUDGMENT\n\n[1] KENTRIDGE  AJ:    This  case  arises  from  a  criminal  trial\n\nbefore Hugo J in the Natal Provincial Division.  In this\n\n\f2\n\nCourt it was heard together with the case of Mhlungu and \n\nFour Others v The State (Case No CCT/25/94) which also arose from\n\na criminal trial in the Natal Provincial Division.  Each of them\n\nhas  come  to  this  Court  by  way  of  a  referral  by  the  judge\n\npresiding over the trial.  In each case the judge referred to\n\nthis  Court  for  decision  the  question  whether  section\n\n217(1)(b)(ii)  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Act  No  51  of  1977  is\n\ninconsistent with the provisions of the Republic of South Africa\n\nConstitution, 1993.  If we so find it will be our duty under\n\nsection  98(5)  of  the  Constitution  to  declare  the  provision\n\ninvalid.  In the Mhlungu case the judge also referred to us the\n\nquestion  whether,  having  regard  to  section  241(8)  of  the\n\nConstitution,  the  provisions  of  Chapter  3  of  the  Constitution\n\napply  to  the  proceedings  before  him.    Section  241(8)  raises\n\nimportant  issues  which  do  not  directly  touch  the  Zuma  case.\n\nConsequently, we propose to give judgment at this stage only in\n\nthe Zuma case, and to deal with the Mhlungu case in due course\n\nin a separate judgment.\n\n[2] In this case (as in the Mhlungu case) this Court itself has\n\nraised the issue whether the referral was competent. It is\n\nnecessary to set out in some detail the circumstances of\n\nthe criminal trial which led to the referral to this Court.\n\nBefore doing so, however, I must outline the history and\n\neffect of the challenged sub-paragraph of section 217 of\n\n\fthe Criminal Procedure Act.\n\n3\n\n[3] The section deals with the admissibility in evidence of a\n\nconfession made by an accused person before trial.  Sub-\n\nsection (1) and proviso (a) thereto read as follows -\n\n\"(1)\n\nEvidence of any confession made by any person in relation to the\ncommission of any offence shall, if such confession is proved to\nhave been freely and voluntarily made by such person in his sound\nand  sober  senses  and  without  having  been  unduly  influenced\nthereto,  be  admissible  in  evidence  against  such  person  at\ncriminal proceedings relating to such offence :  \nProvided - \n\n(a)\n\nthat  a  confession  made  to  a  peace  officer,  other  than  a\nmagistrate or justice, or, in the case of a peace officer\nreferred to in section 334, a confession made to such peace\nofficer which relates to an offence with reference to which\nsuch  peace  officer  is  authorized  to  exercise  any  power\nconferred  upon  him  under  that  section,  shall  not  be\nadmissible  in  evidence  unless  confirmed  and  reduced  to\nwriting in the presence of a magistrate or justice;...\"\n\n \n\nIt  will  be  seen  that  this  sub-section  requires  the\n\nprosecution,  if  it  wishes  to  put  the  confession  in\n\nevidence, to prove that it was freely and voluntarily made,\n\nand was not unduly influenced.  This means, at the least,\n\nproof that it was not induced by violence, or by threats or\n\npromises made by a person in authority.  R v Barlin 1926 AD\n\n459, 462;  R v Nhleko 1960(4) SA 712(A);  S v Mpetha and\n\nothers (2) 1983(1) SA 576(C).  This rule, which reflects a\n\nlong-standing  principle  of  the  English  law  of  criminal\n\nprocedure  and  evidence,  was  embodied  in  the  Evidence\n\nOrdinance of the Cape Colony in 1830.  The rationale of the\n\nrule excluding involuntary confessions (or admissions) has\n\nbeen  much  discussed.  See  Hoffmann  and  Zeffertt,  South\n\n\f4\n\nAfrican Law of Evidence, 4th ed. pp 205, 216-7 ;  Cross on\n\nEvidence, 6th ed pp 601-3.   I shall return in due course to\n\nthe historical development of the rule.  At this stage it\n\nis  sufficient  to  say  that  before  the  Union  of  the  four\n\nprovinces in 1910 it was well established in all parts of\n\nSouth Africa that it was for the prosecution to prove that\n\nany confession on which it wished to rely was freely and\n\nvoluntarily made.\n\n[4] Proviso  (a),  on  the  other  hand,  has  no  counterpart  in\n\nEnglish law.  It was introduced into South African law by\n\nthe Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act, 1917.  Its general\n\neffect is that confessions made to members of the police\n\nforce who are not justices of the peace are inadmissible.\n\nAn accused person who has confessed, or expressed a wish to\n\nconfess, to a police officer who is not a justice of the\n\npeace  should  be  taken  to  a  magistrate  or  justice  of  the\n\npeace who may take down the confession in writing.  Even\n\nwhere  the  police  officer  is  a  justice  of  the  peace  the\n\naccused person may be taken to a magistrate who may take\n\ndown the confession in writing.  The magistrate ought, of\n\ncourse, to be satisfied that the confession is freely and\n\nvoluntarily  made,  and  should  record  that  fact  in  the\n\ndocument containing the confession.  It is at that stage\n\nthat proviso (b) to section 217(1) becomes relevant.  That\n\n\f5\n\nproviso reads -\n\n     \"Provided-\n\n     ...\n\n\"(b)\n\nthat where the confession is made to a magistrate and reduced to\nwriting  by  him,  or  is  confirmed  and  reduced  to  writing  in  the\npresence  of  a  magistrate,  the  confession  shall,  upon  the  mere\nproduction thereof at the proceedings in question-\n\n(i)\n\nbe admissible in evidence against such person if it appears\nfrom the document in which the confession is contained that\nthe confession was made by a person whose name corresponds\nto  that  of  such  person  and,  in  the  case  of  a  confession\nmade  to  a  magistrate  or  confirmed  in  the  presence  of  a\nmagistrate through an interpreter, if a certificate by the\ninterpreter appears on such document to the effect that he\ninterpreted  truly  and  correctly  and  to  the  best  of  his\nability with regard to the contents of the confession and\nany question put to such person by the magistrate;  and\n\n(ii)\n\nbe presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have been\nfreely and voluntarily made by such person in his sound and\nsober  senses  and  without  having  been  unduly  influenced\nthereto,  if  it  appears  from  the  document  in  which  the\nconfession is contained that the confession was made freely\nand  voluntarily  by  such  person  in  his  sound  and  sober\nsenses and without having been unduly influenced thereto.\n\nIt  is  sub-paragraph  (ii)  of  this  proviso  that  is  under\n\nattack  in  the  present  case.    It  was  introduced  into  the\n\ncriminal procedure code in 1977.  In the circumstances set\n\nout  in  the  sub-paragraph  it  places  on  the  accused  the\n\nburden  of  proving  that  the  confession  recorded  by  the\n\nmagistrate was not free and voluntary.  The words \"unless\n\nthe contrary is proved\" place an onus on the accused which\n\nmust be discharged on a balance of probabilities. He does\n\nnot discharge the onus merely by raising a doubt.  If, at\n\nthe  end  of  the  voir  dire  (or  trial-within-a-trial)  the\n\nprobabilities are evenly balanced the presumption prevails.\n\nSee Ex parte Minister of Justice:  in re R v Bolon 1941 AD\n\n345, 360-1;  S v Nene and Others (2) 1979(2) SA 521(D);  S\n\n\f6\n\nv Mkanzi and Another 1979(2) SA 757(T);  S v Mphahlele and\n\nAnother 1982(4) SA 505(A) 512.\n\n[5] I  add,  by  way  of  completeness,  that  sub-section  (2)  of\n\nsection 217 provides that the prosecution may lead evidence\n\nin rebuttal of evidence advanced by an accused in rebuttal\n\nof the presumption under proviso (b).\n\n[6] In the case before us the prosecution tendered confessions\n\nwhich  had  been  made  by  two  of  the  accused  before  a\n\nmagistrate  and  reduced  to  writing,  and  invoked  the\n\npresumption in proviso (b).  \n\n[7]\n\nThe accused were indicted on two counts of murder and one\n\nof  robbery.    At  their  trial  before  Hugo  J  and  assessors\n\nthey  pleaded  not  guilty.    Two  of  the  accused  had  made\n\nstatements before a magistrate which counsel for the state\n\ntendered  as  admissible  confessions.  Admissibility  was\n\ncontested by counsel for the accused and a trial-within-a-\n\ntrial ensued.  At the outset  defence counsel raised the\n\nissue of the constitutionality of section 217(1)(b)(ii) of\n\nthe  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  and  counsel  for  both  the\n\ndefence and the prosecution consented (in terms of section\n\n101(6) of the Constitution) to the trial judge's deciding\n\nthat  issue.    The  trial-within-a-trial  nonetheless\n\n\f7\n\nproceeded.  The accused testified that they had made their\n\nstatements by reason of assaults on them by the police and\n\nthe threat of further assaults.  The policemen concerned\n\ndenied  this,  but  two  women  called  as  witnesses  by  the\n\ndefence said that they had seen the police assaulting the\n\naccused.  At the end of the evidence the court concluded\n\nunanimously  that  while  they  were  not  satisfied  beyond  a\n\nreasonable doubt that the statements had been freely and\n\nvoluntarily made, the accused had failed to discharge the\n\nonus  upon  them  under  proviso  (b)  on  a  balance  of\n\nprobabilities.  In his judgment, given on 10th August, 1994\n\nand reported as S v Zuma and Others 1995(1) BCLR 49 (N),\n\nHugo J said -\n\n\"Had  we  been  convinced  that  section  217(1)(b)  of  the\nCriminal Procedure Act was still valid and constitutional\nwe would therefore have had little hesitation in accepting\nthat the accused had not discharged the  onus placed upon\nthem by that section.  The constitutionality therefore of\nsection  217(1)(b)  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Act  is\ntherefore crucial to the decision of this case.\"\n\nLater in his judgment he said -\n\n\"It is quite clear from what I have said that the site of\nthe onus will be decisive in this case, at least in so far\nas the admissibility of this evidence is concerned.  If it\nis  held  by  the  constitutional  court  that  section\n217(1)(b)(ii) is unconstitutional it will lead to the most\nunfortunate  result  that  two  persons  who  have  in  effect\nadmitted  under  oath  in  this  Court  that  they  indeed\ncommitted these offences may be acquitted but that may well\nbe the effect of the constitution or the provisions of the\nconstitution upon matters of this nature.  It is also the\neffect  of  the  hearing  of  matters  of  this  nature  in  a\nseparate trial-within-a-trial, the evidence of which is not\nadmissible in deciding the merits of the conviction.\"  \n\n\f8\n\nThe  reference  to  the  admissions  of  the  two  accused  that\n\nthey  had  committed  the  offences  arose  from  the  evidence\n\nwhich they had given in the course of the trial-within-a-\n\ntrial.    As  Hugo  J  fully  appreciated,  that  evidence  was\n\ngiven  only  in  the  context  of  the  trial-within-a-trial,\n\nwhere the only issue was admissibility.  To that issue the\n\ntruth  of  the  confession  was  irrelevant.    Thus,  in  S  v\n\nRadebe and Another, 1968(4) SA 410(A) 419 Ogilvie Thompson\n\nJ A said-\n\n\"It not infrequently occurs that, although the presiding\nJudge may think that the contents of a tendered confession\nare true, the circumstances whereunder the confession was\nmade compel its exclusion\".\n\nSee  also  S  v  Gaba  1985(4)  SA  734(A)  749;    S  v  Talane\n\n1986(3) SA 196(A) 205; S v de Vries 1989(1) SA 228(A), 233-\n\n4.\n\n[8] In  the  event,  notwithstanding  the  consent  given  by  the\n\nparties under section 101(6) Hugo J refrained from giving\n\na decision on the validity of the proviso, but referred the\n\nquestion to this court, and adjourned the trial sine die.\n\n[9] The question of the competence of Hugo J's referral arises,\n\nand has been argued before us by counsel for the accused\n\nand for the State.  In addition we have received a Notice\n\nof Motion under the hand of Mr. T P McNally SC, Attorney-\n\nGeneral for Natal, seeking direct access to the Court in\n\n\f9\n\nterms of section 100(2) of the Constitution on the grounds\n\nthat  it  is  in  the  interests  of  justice  that  a  binding\n\ndecision be given as soon as possible on the validity of\n\nsection 217(1)(b)(ii).\n\n[10] By  reason  of  the  consent  of  the  parties  under  section\n\n101(6)  the  issue  of  the  constitutionality    of  section\n\n217(1)(b)(ii)  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Act  no  longer\n\nremained within the exclusive jurisdiction of this Court,\n\nand fell within the jurisdiction of Hugo J.  For reasons\n\nwhich  will  be  given  in  detail  in  the  Mhlungu  case  the\n\nreferral by Hugo J was wholly incompetent.  That was indeed\n\nthe submission of the State in its written argument, and\n\nthe point was rightly conceded by counsel for the accused.\n\nEven if a rapid resort to this Court were convenient that\n\nwould not relieve the judge from making his own decision on\n\na  constitutional  issue  within  his  jurisdiction.    The\n\njurisdiction  conferred  on  judges  of  the  Provincial  and\n\nLocal Divisions of the Supreme Court under section 101(3)\n\nis  not  an  optional  jurisdiction.    The  jurisdiction  was\n\nconferred  in  order  to  be  exercised.  It  was  in  these\n\ncircumstances  that  the  Attorney-General  of  Natal  applied\n\nunder section 100(2) of the Constitution for direct access\n\nto the Court.  Section 100(2) reads -\n\n\"(2)\n\nThe  rules  of  the  Constitutional  Court  may  make\nprovision for direct access to the Court where it is\nin the interest of justice to do so in respect of any\n\n\f10\n\nmatter over which it has jurisdiction.\"\n\nRule 17, subrules (1) and (2) of the Rules of this Court\nprovide-\n\n  \n\n(1) \n\nThe  Court  shall  allow  direct  access  in  terms  of  section\n100(2)  of  the  Constitution  in  exceptional  circumstances\nonly, which will ordinarily exist only where the matter is\nof such urgency, or otherwise of such public importance,\nthat  the  delay  necessitated  by  the  use  of  the  ordinary\nprocedures would prejudice the public interest or prejudice\nthe ends of justice and good government.\n\n(2)\n\nThe  special  procedure  referred  to  in  subrule  (1)  may  be\nsanctioned by the Court on application made to it in terms\nof these rules.\n\n[11] The  Attorney-General  of  Natal  submits  in  his  supporting\n\naffidavit  that  if  the  matter  is  sent  back  to  the  trial\n\ncourt without our deciding the issue it would have to be\n\nreferred again to this Court at the end of the trial.  More\n\nimportant, he informs us that prevailing uncertainty as to\n\nthe constitutionality of section 217(1)(b)(ii) has resulted\n\nin inconsistency in practice in Natal and elsewhere in the\n\nRepublic.  That uncertainty would remain unresolved until\n\na suitable case came properly before this Court.  We agree\n\nwith the Attorney-General of Natal and with Mr d'Oliviera\n\nSC, the Attorney-General of the Transvaal, who appeared for\n\nthe  State  that  this  state  of  affairs  must  seriously\n\nprejudice the general administration of justice as well as\n\nthe  interests  of  the  numerous  accused  persons  affected.\n\nThe admissibility of confessions is a question which arises\n\ndaily  in  our  criminal  courts  and  prolonged  uncertainty\n\nwould be quite unacceptable.  As appears from the terms of\n\n\f11\n\nRule  17,  direct  access  is  contemplated  in  only  the  most\n\nexceptional cases, and it is certainly not intended to be\n\nused to legitimate an incompetent reference.  But in the\n\nspecial  circumstances  set  out  in  the  affidavit  the\n\napplication  under  rule  17  was  fully  justified.    Mr.\n\nMcNally's application is accordingly granted, so that the\n\nquestion  of  the  validity  of  section  217(1)(b)(ii)  is\n\nproperly before this Court.\n\n[12] Counsel for the accused has attacked section 217(1)(b)(ii)\n\nas being in conflict with section 25 of the Constitution.\n\nThe  particular  provisions  of  section  25    relied  on\n\nindividually or cumulatively are the following -\n\n\"25 (2)\n\nEvery person arrested for the alleged commission of\nan offence shall ... have the right -\n\n(a)\nshe \n\npromptly to be informed, in a language which he or\nunderstands, that he or she has the right to\nremain  silent  and  to  be  warned  of  the\nconsequences of making any statement;\n\n...\n\n(c)\n\n...\n\n    \n\nnot to be compelled to make a confession or admission\nwhich could be used in evidence against him or her ;\nand\n\n    (3)\n\nEvery accused person shall have the right to a fair trial,\nwhich shall include the right -\n\n...\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nto be presumed innocent and to remain silent during\nplea proceedings or trial and not to testify during\ntrial ;\n\nto  adduce  and  challenge  evidence,  and  not  to  be  a\ncompellable witness against himself or herself;\n\nThe concepts embodied in these provisions are by no means\n\n\f12\n\nan  entirely  new  departure  in  South  African  criminal\n\nprocedure.    The  presumption  of  innocence,  the  right  of\n\nsilence and the proscription of compelled confessions have\n\nfor 150 years or more been recognised as basic principles\n\nof  our  law,  although  all  of  them  have  to  a  greater  or\n\nlesser degree been eroded by statute and in some cases by\n\njudicial decision.  The resulting body of common law and\n\nstatute  law  forms  part  of  the  background  to  section  25.\n\nThe provisions of section 25 are more specific than many of\n\nthe  other  provisions  of  Chapter  3.    They  do  nonetheless\n\ngive rise to problems of interpretation.\n\n[13] The  principles  upon  which  a  constitutional  bill  of\n\nfundamental  rights  should  be  interpreted  have  been  the\n\nsubject of numerous judicial dicta, in jurisdictions abroad\n\nand in Southern Africa.  Many of these principles have been\n\nre-stated and applied in the judgments of Provincial and\n\nLocal Divisions interpreting our own Constitution, and in\n\njudgments of other Southern African courts.  The judgment\n\nof Friedman J in  Nyamakazi v President of Bophututswana,\n\n1994(1)  BCLR  92(B)  is  a  veritable  thesaurus  of\n\ninternational authority.  Khala v The Minister of Safety &\n\nSecurity 1994(2) BCLR 89(W), 92-4; 1994 (4) SA 218(W), 222-\n\n4  per  Myburgh  J  also  contains  a  useful  collection  of\n\ncitations.    It  is  not  necessary  to  traverse  all  the\n\n\frelevant dicta but some of them bear repeating.\n\n13\n\n[14] The  first  of  these  is  the  much-quoted  passage  from  the\n\njudgment  of  Lord  Wilberforce  in  the  Privy  Council  in\n\nMinister of Home Affairs (Bermuda) v Fisher [1980] AC 319\n\n(PC), 328-9.  After referring to the influence of certain\n\ninternational  conventions  on  the  constitutions  of  former\n\ncolonies of the British Commonwealth, he said that these\n\ncalled for\n\n\"a  generous  interpretation  ...  suitable  to  give  to\nindividuals the full measure of the fundamental rights and\nfreedoms referred to,\"\n\nand  that  the  constitution  called  for  \"principles  of\n\ninterpretation of its own\".  He went on to say -\n\n\"This is in no way to say that there are no rules of law\nwhich should apply to the interpretation of a constitution.\nA constitution is a legal instrument giving rise, amongst\nother things, to individual rights capable of enforcement\nin a court of law.  Respect must be paid to the language\nwhich has been used and to the traditions and the usages\nwhich  have  given  meaning  to  that  language.    It  is  quite\nconsistent with this, and with the recognition that rules\nof  interpretation  may  apply,  to  take  as  a  point  of\ndeparture for the process of interpretation a recognition\nof the character and origin of the instrument, and to be\nguided  by  the  principle  of  giving  full  recognition  and\neffect  to  those  fundamental  rights  and  freedoms  with  a\nstatement of which the constitution commences.\"\n\nThis  judgment  was  cited  with  approval  by  the  Appellate\n\nDivision in S v Marwane 1982(3) SA 717(A), 748-9.  See also\n\nthe  judgment  of  the  Full  Bench  of  the  Supreme  Court  of\n\nNamibia  in  Minister  of  Defence,  Namibia  v  Mwandinghi\n\n1992(2) SA 355 (Nm SC), 362.  \n\n\f14\n\n[15] In R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd  (1985)18  DLR  (4th) 321,395-6,\n\nDickson  J  (later  Chief  Justice  of  Canada)  said,  with\n\nreference to the Canadian Charter of Rights -\n\n\"The  meaning  of  a  right  or  freedom  guaranteed  by  the\nCharter was to be ascertained by an analysis of the purpose\nof such a guarantee ;  it was to be understood, in other\nwords,  in  the  light  of  the  interests  it  was  meant  to\nprotect.  In my view this analysis is to be undertaken, and\nthe purpose of the right or freedom in question is to be\nsought by reference to the character and larger objects of\nthe Charter itself, to the language chosen to articulate\nthe specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of\nthe concept enshrined, and where applicable, to the meaning\nand purpose of the other specific rights and freedoms with\nwhich it is associated within the text of the Charter.  The\ninterpretation  should  be  ....  a  generous  rather  than\nlegalistic  one,  aimed  at  fulfilling  the  purpose  of  a\nguarantee and the securing for individuals the full benefit\nof the Charter's protection.\"\n\nBoth Lord Wilberforce and Dickson J emphasised that regard\n\nmust be paid to the legal history, traditions and usages of\n\nthe country concerned, if the purposes of its constitution\n\nare  be  fully  understood.    This  must  be  right.    I  may\n\nnonetheless be permitted to refer to what I said in another\n\ncourt  of  another  constitution  albeit  in  a  dissenting\n\njudgment -\n\n\"Constitutional rights conferred without express limitation\nshould  not  be  cut  down  by  reading  implicit  restrictions\ninto them, so as to bring them into line with the common\nlaw.\n\nAttorney-General v Moagi 1982(2) Botswana LR 124,184\n\n[16] That  caveat  is  of  particular  importance  in  interpreting\n\nsection  25(3)  of  the  Constitution.  The  right  to  a  fair\n\ntrial conferred by that  provision is broader than the list\n\nof specific rights set out in paragraphs (a) to (j) of the\n\n\f15\n\nsub-section.  It embraces a concept of substantive fairness\n\nwhich  is  not  to  be  equated  with  what  might  have  passed\n\nmuster in our criminal courts before the Constitution came\n\ninto force. In S v Rudman and Another; S v Mthwana 1992(1)\n\nSA 343(A), the Appellate Division, while not decrying the\n\nimportance of fairness in criminal proceedings, held that\n\nthe function of a court of criminal appeal in South Africa\n\nwas to enquire\n\n\"whether  there  has  been  an  irregularity  or    illegality,\nthat  is  a  departure  from  the  formalities,  rules  and\nprinciples of procedure according to which our law requires\na criminal trial to be initiated or conducted\".\n\nA court of appeal, it was said, (at 377)\n\n    \n\n\"does not enquire whether the trial was fair in accordance\nwith 'notions of basic fairness and justice', or with the\n'ideas  underlying  the  concept  of  justice  which  are  the\nbasis \ncriminal\nadministration'.\"\n\ncivilised \n\nsystems \n\nall \n\nof \n\nof \n\nThat was an authoritative statement of the law before 27th\n\nApril  1994.  Since  that  date  section  25(3)  has  required\n\ncriminal  trials  to  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  just\n\nthose \"notions of basic fairness and justice\".  It is now\n\nfor all courts hearing criminal trials or criminal appeals\n\nto give content to those  notions.\n\n[17] I must also refer to Qozoleni v Minister of Law and Order\n\n1994(1)  BCLR  75(E);  1994(3)  SA  625(E).    The  judgment  of\n\nFroneman  J.  contains  much  of  value  in  its  approach  to\n\nconstitutional interpretation.  The learned judge says (at\n\n\f16\n\n81) that the previous constitutional system of this country\n\nwas the fundamental \"mischief\" to be remedied by the new\n\nConstitution.    He  says  (at  80)  that  because  the\n\nConstitution is the supreme law against which all law is to\n\nbe tested,\n\n\"it  must  be  examined  with  a  view  to  extracting  from  it\nthose principles or values against which such law ... can\nbe measured.\"\n\nHe  adds  on  the  same  page  that  the  Constitution  must  be\n\ninterpreted so as \"to give clear expression to the values\n\nit seeks to nurture for a future South Africa.\"  This is\n\nundoubtedly true.  South African Courts are indeed enjoined\n\nby section 35 of the Constitution to interpret Chapter 3 so\n\nas    \"to  promote  the  values  which  underlie  an  open  and\n\ndemocratic  society  based  on  freedom  and  equality\",  and,\n\nwhere  applicable,  to  have  regard  to  relevant  public\n\ninternational law.  That section also permits our courts to\n\nhave regard to comparable foreign case law.\n\nI am, however, sure that Froneman J, in his reference to\n\nthe fundamental \"mischief\" to be remedied, did not intend\n\nto say that all the principles of law which have hitherto\n\ngoverned our courts are to be ignored.  Those principles\n\nobviously contain much of lasting value.  Nor, I am equally\n\nsure,  did  the  learned  judge  intend  to  suggest  that  we\n\nshould neglect the language of the Constitution.  While we\n\nmust  always  be  conscious  of  the  values  underlying  the\n\nConstitution,  it  is  nonetheless  our  task  to  interpret  a\n\n\f17\n\nwritten instrument.   I am well aware of the fallacy of\n\nsupposing  that  general  language  must  have  a  single\n\n\"objective\" meaning.  Nor is it easy to avoid the influence\n\nof  one's  personal  intellectual  and  moral  preconceptions.\n\nBut  it  cannot  be  too  strongly  stressed  that  the\n\nConstitution  does  not  mean  whatever  we  might  wish  it  to\n\nmean.  \n\n[18] We  must  heed  Lord  Wilberforce's  reminder  that  even  a\n\nconstitution is a legal instrument, the language of which\n\nmust be respected.  If the language used by the lawgiver is\n\nignored  in  favour  of  a  general  resort  to  \"values\"  the\n\nresult  is  not  interpretation  but  divination.    If  I  may\n\nagain quote S v Moagi, supra, at 184, I would say that a\n\nconstitution\n\n\"embodying fundamental rights should as far as its language\n\npermits be given a broad construction\"\n\n(My emphasis),\n\n[19] As pointed out above, section 217(1)(b)(ii) creates a legal\n\npresumption,  with  the  legal  burden  of  rebuttal  on  the\n\naccused  -  what  has  been  called  a  \"reverse  onus\".    The\n\nlegitimacy of such provisions has been considered by courts\n\nas varied as the United States Supreme Court, The Canadian\n\nSupreme Court, the Privy Council and the European Court of\n\nHuman  Rights  (and  doubtless  others)  in  the  light  of\n\n\f18\n\nprovisions  entrenching,  in  varying  language,  the\n\npresumption  of  innocence,  the  right  to  silence  and  the\n\nprivilege  against  self-incrimination  -  a  privilege  not\n\nexpressly  referred  to  in  section  25.      The  case  law  of\n\nthese  courts  -  which  are  undoubtedly  courts  of  open  and\n\ndemocratic  societies  -  indicates  that  reverse  onus\n\nprovisions are by no means uncommon and are not necessarily\n\nunconstitutional.    Reverse  onus  provisions  in  our  own\n\nstatute law are also not uncommon.  To go no further than\n\nthe  Criminal  Procedure  Act  one  finds,  for  example,  the\n\npresumptions arising from entries in marriage registers on\n\ncharges  of  bigamy  (section  237),  the  presumption  of\n\nknowledge  of  falsity  arising  from  proof  of  a  factually\n\nfalse representation (section 245) and the presumption of\n\nhaving failed to pay tax arising merely from an allegation\n\nin  a  charge  sheet  (section  249).    Foreign  courts  have\n\ngrappled  with  the  problem  of  reconciling  presumptions\n\nreversing  the  onus  of  proof  with  the  constitutional\n\npresumption of innocence.  The different solutions which\n\nthey have suggested are illuminating.\n\n[20] The  courts  of  the  United  States  have  over  many  years\n\nattempted to enunciate a governing principle.  Tot v The\n\nUnited States 319 US 463 (1943) concerned a federal statute\n\nmaking it an offence for a person convicted of violence to\n\n\f19\n\nreceive any firearm or ammunition which had been shipped or\n\ntransported  in  interstate  or  foreign  commerce.      The\n\nstatute  provided  that  \"the  possession  of  a  firearm  or\n\nammunition by any such person shall be presumptive evidence\n\nthat such firearm or ammunition was shipped transported or\n\nreceived  as  the  case  may  be,  by  such  person  ...  in\n\nviolation of this Act\".   The Supreme Court held that while\n\nCongress  and  state  legislatures  had  \"power  to  prescribe\n\nwhat evidence is to be received in the courts of the United\n\nStates\", the due process clauses of the Constitution \n\n\"set  limits  upon  the  power  of  Congress  or  that  of  a  state\nlegislature  to  make  the  proof  of  one  fact  or  group  of  facts\nevidence of the existence of the ultimate fact on which guilt is\npredicated.\" (per Roberts J at 467)\n\nThe test of the validity of such a presumption, the Court\n\nsaid, was that there be a \n\n\"rational  connection  between  the  facts  proved  and  the  fact\npresumed ... .  But where the inference is so strained as not to\nhave  a  reasonable  relation  to  the  circumstances  of  life  as  we\nknow them it is not competent for the legislature to create it as\na rule governing the procedure of the courts.  (467-8)\n\nOn this test the presumption was struck down.  Twenty-five\n\nyears later a somewhat stricter test was formulated.  In\n\nLeary v United States 395 US 6(1969) the Supreme Court had\n\nto consider a statute under which possession of marihuana\n\nwas  deemed  to  be  sufficient  evidence  of  the  offence  of\n\nillegal  importation,  unless  the  defendant  explained  his\n\npossession  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  jury.      The\n\npresumption was held to be a denial of due process of law.\n\n\f20\n\nHaving  considered  Tot  and  some  later  cases,  Harlan  J,\n\nspeaking for the Court, said that\n\n\"a  criminal  statutory  presumption  must  be  regarded  as\n'irrational' or 'arbitrary' and hence unconstitutional, unless it\ncan at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed\nfact  is  more  likely  than  not  to  flow  from  the  proved  fact  on\nwhich it is made to depend.\" (page 36)\n\n(Harlan  J  added  the  rider  that  in  this  assessment  the\n\nCongressional determination favouring the presumption must\n\nweigh heavily.)\n\n[21] \"Rational connection\" is a useful screening test, but not\n\na conclusive one.   This was acknowledged in County Court\n\nof Ulster County, New York, et al v Allen et al 442 US 140\n\n(1979).    In  relation  to  a  mandatory  (i.e.  legal)\n\npresumption Stevens J giving judgment for the majority of\n\nthe Supreme Court, said, at 167, that\n\n\"since  the  prosecution  bears  the  burden  of  establishing\nguilt, it may not rest its case entirely on a presumption\nunless  the  fact  proved  is  sufficient  to  support  the\ninference of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \n\nThe \"rational connection\" test has been considered in the\n\nsubstantial  jurisprudence  which  the  Canadian  courts  have\n\ndeveloped  in  construing  their  Charter  of  Rights.    The\n\nCanadian cases on reverse onus provisions seem to me to be\n\nparticularly helpful, not only because of their persuasive\n\nreasoning,  but  because  section  1  of  the  Charter  has  a\n\nlimitation  clause  analogous  to  section  33  of  the  South\n\nAfrican  Constitution.    This  calls  for  a  \"two-stage\"\n\napproach.    First,  has  there  been  a  contravention  of  a\n\n\f21\n\nguaranteed  right?    If  so,  is  it  justified  under  the\n\nlimitation clause?   The single stage approach (as in the\n\nUS Constitution or the Hong Kong Bill of Rights) may call\n\nfor  a  more  flexible  approach  to  the  construction  of  the\n\nfundamental right, whereas the two-stage approach may call\n\nfor  a  broader  interpretation  of  the  fundamental  right,\n\nqualified only at the second stage.   In Attorney-General\n\nof Hong Kong v Lee Kwong-kut, [1993] AC 951 (PC), an appeal\n\nto  the  Privy  Council  from  Hong  Kong,  Lord  Woolf,  while\n\nnoting that the results of the two approaches often tend to\n\nbe  similar,  observed  (at  967  H)  that  the  two-stage\n\napproach, \n\nin \n\nlaying \n\ndown \n\nspecific \n\ncriteria \n\nof\n\njustification, had important practical consequences.  See\n\nalso  Cachalia  &  others,  Fundamental  Rights  in  the  New\n\nConstitution, pp5-7.\n\n[22] There  are  numerous  Canadian  cases  dealing  with  the\n\nconstitutionality  of  reverse  onus  provisions.    I  shall\n\nrefer only to three of them.  In R v Oakes (1986) 26 DLR\n\n(4th) 200 the Supreme Court of Canada had before it an Act\n\nof Parliament which provided that if a person was proved to\n\nbe in unlawful possession of a narcotic he was presumed to\n\nbe in possession of it for the purposes of trafficking (a\n\nmore serious offence) unless he proved the contrary.   This\n\nproof,  the  Court  held,  had  to  be  on  a  balance  of\n\n\f22\n\nprobabilities.    This  presumption  was  held  to  be\n\ninconsistent with the presumption of innocence guaranteed\n\nby  section  11(d)  of  the  Canadian  Charter  of  Rights  and\n\nFreedoms.  Dickson CJC said at 212-3 -\n\n\"The  presumption  of  innocence  protects  the  fundamental\nliberty and human dignity of any and every person accused\nby the State of criminal conduct.  An individual charged\nwith  a  criminal  offence  faces  grave  social  and  personal\nconsequences, including potential loss of physical liberty,\nsubjection  to  social  stigma  and  ostracism  from  the\ncommunity,  as  well  as  other  social,  psychological  and\neconomic  harms.    In  light  of  the  gravity  of  these\nconsequences, the presumption of innocence is crucial.  It\nensures  that  until  the  State  proves  an  accused's  guilt\nbeyond all reasonable doubt, he or she is innocent.  This\nis essential in a society committed to fairness and social\njustice.\"\n\nAnd, at 222,\n\n\"If an accused bears the burden of disproving on a balance\nof  probabilities  an  essential  element  of  an  offence,  it\nwould  be  possible  for  a  conviction  to  occur  despite  the\nexistence of a reasonable doubt.  This would arise if the\naccused adduced sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable\ndoubt as to his or her innocence but did not convince the\njury on a balance of probabilities that the presumed fact\nwas untrue.\"\n\nHe held further that the \"rational connection\" test, while\n\npossibly  useful  at  the  stage  when  the  State  sought  to\n\njustify an infringement of a guaranteed right in terms of\n\nsection  1  of  the  Charter,  was  not  in  itself  an  adequate\n\nprotection for the constitutional presumption of innocence.\n\n\"A basic fact may rationally tend to prove a presumed fact,\nbut not prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt.  An\naccused  person  could  thereby  be  convicted  despite  the\npresence  of  a  reasonable  doubt.    This  would  violate  the\npresumption of innocence.\"\n\n[23] R  v  Whyte  (1988)  51  DLR  (4th)  481  concerned  a  statute\n\ncreating the offence of having care or control of a motor\n\n\f23\n\nvehicle  while  one's  ability  to  drive  was  impaired  by\n\nalcohol.  Under the statute, upon proof that the accused\n\noccupied the driver's seat he was deemed to have the care\n\nand control of the vehicle unless he established that he\n\ndid not enter the vehicle for the purpose of setting it in\n\nmotion.  This presumption, too, was held to be a violation\n\nof the right to the presumption of innocence.  The Supreme\n\nCourt, again speaking through Dickson CJC, held that it was\n\nirrelevant  that  the  presumption  did  not  relate  to  an\n\n\"essential element\" in the offence (cf R v Oakes, supra at\n\n222).  The Chief Justice, at 493, said -\n\n\"In the case at bar, the Attorney-General of Canada argued\nthat since the intention to set the vehicle in motion is\nnot  an  element  of  the  offence,  s.  237(1)(a)  does  not\ninfringe the presumption of innocence.  Counsel relied on\nthe passage from Oakes quoted above, with its reference to\nan  \"essential  element\",  to  support  this  argument.    The\naccused here is required to disprove a fact collateral to\nthe substantive offence, unlike Oakes where the accused was\nrequired to disprove an element of the offence.\n\nThe short answer to this argument is that the distinction between\nelements  of  the  offence  and  other  aspects  of  the  charge  is\nirrelevant  to  the  s.  11(d)  inquiry.    The  real  concern  is  not\nwhether the accused must disprove an element or prove an excuse,\nbut  that  an  accused  may  be  convicted  while  a  reasonable  doubt\nexists.  When that possibility exists, there is a breach of the\npresumption of innocence.\n\nThe  exact  characterization  of  a  factor  as  an  essential\nelement,  a  collateral  factor,  an  excuse,  or  a  defence\nshould  not  affect  the  analysis  of  the  presumption  of\ninnocence.  It is the final effect of a provision on the\nverdict  that  is  decisive.    If  an  accused  is  required  to\nprove some fact on the balance of probabilities to avoid\nconviction,  the  provision  violates  the  presumption  of\ninnocence  because  it  permits  a  conviction  in  spite  of  a\nreasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact as to the\nguilt of the accused.\"\n\n[24] In 1992, in R v Downey 90 DLR (4th) 449, the Supreme Court\n\n\f24\n\nof Canada dealt with a statutory presumption that a person\n\nwho  lives  with  or  is  habitually  in  the  company  of\n\nprostitutes,  is,  in  the  absence  of  evidence  to  the\n\ncontrary, committing the offence of \"living on the avails\n\n[i.e. proceeds] of another person's prostitution\".   This\n\npresumption was also held to infringe the presumption of\n\ninnocence (although it was held by a majority to be in all\n\nthe  circumstances  a  justifiable  infringement.)    The\n\njudgment  of  Cory  J  at  456  contains  a  useful  analysis  of\n\ndifferent types of presumption.   The type with which we\n\nare concerned in section 217(1)(b)(ii) is described as a\n\nlegal  presumption  \"where  the  presumed  fact  must  be\n\ndisproved on a balance of probabilities instead of by the\n\nmere raising of evidence to the contrary\".   This is what\n\nthe Canadian courts refer to as a \"reverse onus\" clause, as\n\nI do in this judgment.\n\n[25] Cory J at 461 summarised the principles derived from the\n\nauthorities in seven propositions.  I shall quote the first\n\nthree-\n\n\"I.\n\nII.\n\nIII.\n\nThe  presumption  of  innocence  is  infringed  whenever\nthe  accused  is  liable  to  be  convicted  despite  the\nexistence of a reasonable doubt.\nIf by the provisions of a statutory presumption, an\naccused is required to establish, that is to say to\nprove  or  disprove,  on  a  balance  of  probabilities\neither an element of an offence or an excuse, then it\ncontravenes s. 11(d).  Such a provision would permit\na conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt.\nEven  if  a  rational  connection  exists  between  the\nestablished fact and the fact to be presumed, this\nwould  be  insufficient  to  make  valid  a  presumption\nrequiring the accused to disprove an element of the\n\n\f25\n\noffence.\"\n\nSection  11(d)  of  the  Canadian  Charter  provides  that  any\n\nperson charged with an offence has the right\n\n\"(d)\n\nto be presumed innocent until proven guilty according\nto law in a fair and public hearing by an independent\nand impartial tribunal\".\n\nThis bears a close relationship to section 25(3)(a) and (c)\n\nof our Constitution.  In both Canada and South Africa the\n\npresumption of innocence is derived from the centuries-old\n\nprinciple of English law, forcefully restated by Viscount\n\nSankey in his celebrated speech in Woolmington v Director\n\nof Public Prosecutions [1935] AC 462 (HL), 481, that it is\n\nalways  for  the  prosecution  to  prove  the  guilt  of  the\n\naccused person, and that the proof must be proof beyond a\n\nreasonable  doubt.    Accordingly,  I  consider  that  we  may\n\nappropriately  apply  the  principles  worked  out  by  the\n\nCanadian  Supreme  Court  in  particular  the  first  two\n\nprinciples stated by Cory J, supra.\n\n[26] Does  the  application  of  these  principles  in  itself\n\ndemonstrate a violation of the presumption of innocence in\n\nsection  217(1)(b)(ii)?      Mr  d'Oliviera  for  the  State\n\ncontended that it did not.  The admission of a confession,\n\nhe said, did not conclude the prosecution in favour of the\n\nState.    Thus  in  the  present  case  further  evidence  might\n\nentitle the trial court in this case to review its finding\n\n\f26\n\nthat  the  accused  had  not  discharged  the  onus  on  them.\n\nThere might also be evidence which would lead a court to\n\nfind that a confession, although admissible, was untrue.\n\nMoreover, the presumption did not relate to any element of\n\nthe offence charged, but merely to the voluntary character\n\nof the confession.  This was no more than a question of\n\nadmissibility of evidence.\n\n[27] These arguments were persuasively presented, but in my view\n\nthey cannot be accepted.  A confession by definition is an\n\nadmission  of  all  the  elements  of  the  offence  charged,  a\n\nfull acknowledgment of guilt.  R v Becker 1929 AD 167.  No\n\ndoubt in some cases additional evidence (for example, that\n\nthe  confession  is  false)  will  lead  to  an  acquittal\n\nnotwithstanding the admission of the confession.  But the\n\nvalidity of the presumption is not to be tested on a case\n\nby  case  basis.    In  the  absence  of  other  evidence  the\n\npresumption, unrebutted, stands throughout the trial.  It\n\ncould  therefore  happen  that,  given  proof  aliunde  of  the\n\ncrime itself (section 209 of the Criminal Procedure Act),\n\na conviction could follow from an admissible confession,\n\nnotwithstanding the court's reasonable doubt that it was\n\nfreely and voluntarily made.  The practical effect of the\n\npresumption is that the accused may be required to prove a\n\nfact  on  the  balance  of    probabilities  in  order  to  avoid\n\n\f27\n\nconviction.    Cf.  R  v  Whyte,  supra,  loc.  cit.  (last\n\nparagraph).\n\n[28] In the course of argument I asked Mr d'Oliviera whether, if\n\nthere  were  no  further  evidence,  the  trial  court  in  this\n\ncase could properly give expression to its doubts as to the\n\nvoluntariness of the confession by acquitting the accused.\n\nMr  d'Oliviera  submitted  that  it  could  do  so  -  as  I\n\nunderstood  him,  by  the  judge's  exercising  a  judicial\n\ndiscretion  to  reject  admissible  but  unfairly  prejudicial\n\nevidence.      The  authority  for  the  existence  of  such  a\n\ndiscretion  is  conflicting.  See  R  v  Roets  and  Another\n\n1954(3) SA 512(A), 520; S v Mkanzi and Another 1979(2) SA\n\n757(T);  S  v  Mphahlele  supra.      Even  if  there  is  such  a\n\ndiscretion  and  even  if  it  could  be  exercised  so  as  to\n\novercome  a  statutory  presumption  (surely  a  doubtful\n\nproposition)1 that gives rise to no more than a possibility\n\nof an acquittal; the possibility of a conviction remains.\n\nThe presumption of innocence cannot depend on the exercise\n\nof discretion.\n\n[29] The suggestion that the common law rule placing the onus of\n\n     In England there appears to be a judicial discretion to exclude an admissible confession, for example\nbecause the methods used to obtain it, while not unlawful, were unfair.  R v Sang [1980] A.C. 402 (HL), 437.\n\n\f28\n\nproving voluntariness on the prosecution is merely a rule\n\nof  evidence  and  can  therefore  be  freely  altered  by  the\n\nlegislature deserves and requires fuller consideration. In\n\npart  it  is  answered  by  the  quotation  from  Tot  v  United\n\nStates of America, supra.   In Tregea and Another v Godart\n\nand Another  1939  AD  16,  32  Stratford  CJ  said  that  if  a\n\nrebuttable presumption of law shifts the burden of proof it\n\nis not a mere rule of evidence but a matter of substantive\n\nlaw.    But  even  if  the  common  law  rule  governing  the\n\nadmissibility of confessions is a rule of evidence, it is,\n\nas  I  shall  show,  a  rule  which  lies  at  the  heart  of\n\nimportant  rights  embodied  in  section  25,  including  the\n\nright  to  remain  silent  after  arrest,  the  right  not  be\n\ncompelled  to  make  a  confession  which  can  be  used  in\n\nevidence, the right to be presumed innocent and the right\n\nnot to be a compellable witness against oneself.\n\n[30] The rule itself derives from more than 300 years of English\n\nlegal history.  By the latter half of the 18th century the\n\nrule was clearly stated in its modern form-\n\n\"A confession forced from the mind by the flattery of hope\nor by the torture of fear comes in so questionable a shape,\nwhen it is to be considered as evidence of guilt, that no\ncredit ought to be given to it\" -\n\n               R v Warwickshall (1783) 1 Leach, 263.\n\nIn Ibrahim v R [1914] AC 599 (PC) at 610 Lord Sumner said\n\nthat this was a rule of policy. It would appear that the\n\n\f29\n\nrule  derived  from  a  determination  to  eradicate  the\n\noppressive  and  often  barbaric  methods  of  interrogation\n\nemployed  by  the  Star  Chamber  in  17th  century  England  to\n\nextract  confessions  from  accused  persons.    From  the\n\nabhorrence of those methods there developed the privilege\n\nagainst self-incrimination, and the right of silence, one\n\naspect of which is the exclusion of compelled confessions,\n\nwith  the  onus  placed  on  the  prosecution  to  prove  beyond\n\nreasonable  doubt  that  any  confession  relied  on    was\n\nvoluntary.  In  Smith  v  Director  of  Serious  Fraud  Office\n\n[1993] AC 1 (HL) Lord Mustill distinguished the \"disparate\n\ngroup of immunities\" denoted by the expression \"the right\n\nto  silence\".    At  32  Lord  Mustill  observed  that  the  law\n\nrelating to proof of the voluntariness of confessions was\n\nparticularly important at a time when an accused was not\n\nentitled to give evidence on his own behalf - a disability\n\nremoved in England only in 1898.  Nonetheless, Lord Mustill\n\nsaid, \n\n\"Even now, nearly hundred years after that disability has\nbeen removed, the imprint of the old law is still clearly\nto be seen.\"\n\nIt is indeed.\n\n[31] In Lam Chi-Ming v R, [1991] 2 AC 212 (PC), 220, an appeal\nto the Privy Council from Hong Kong, Lord Griffiths said-\n\n\"Their  lordships  are  of  the  view  that  the  more  recent\nEnglish  cases  established  that  the  rejection  of  an\nimproperly obtained confession is not dependent only upon\npossible unreliability but also upon the principle that a\nman cannot be compelled to incriminate himself and upon the\n\n\f30\n\nimportance that attaches in a civilised society to proper\nbehaviour by the police towards those in their custody. All\nthree of these factors have combined to produce the rule of\nlaw applicable in Hong Kong as well as in England that a\nconfession  is  not  admissible  in  evidence  unless  the\nprosecution establish that it was voluntary. This, perhaps\nthe most fundamental rule of the English criminal law, now\nfinds expression in England in section 76 of the Police and\nCriminal Evidence Act 1984.\"\n\nIn Wong Kam-ming v R [1980] AC 247 (PC), 261, Lord Hailsham\n\nstated the underlying principle in memorable words-\n\n\"any civilised system of criminal jurisprudence must accord\nto  the  judiciary  some  means  of  excluding  confessions  or\nadmissions obtained by improper methods. This is not only\nbecause of the potential unreliability of such statements,\nbut  also,  and  perhaps    mainly,  because  in  a  civilised\nsociety it is vital that persons in custody or charged with\noffences  should  not  be  subjected  to  ill  treatment  or\nimproper pressure in order to extract confessions. It is\ntherefore of very great importance that the courts should\ncontinue  to  insist  that  before  extra-judicial  statements\ncan be admitted  in evidence the prosecution must be made\nto prove beyond reasonable doubt that the statement was not\nobtained  in  a  manner  which  should  be  reprobated  and  was\ntherefore in the truest sense voluntary.\"\n\nIn South Africa, too, courts have over the years recognised\n\nthe origins and the importance of the common law rule. In\n\nR v Camane and Others 1925 AD 570, 575 Innes CJ said-\n\n\"Now, it is an  established principle of our law that no\none  can  be  compelled  to  give  evidence  incriminating\nhimself.  He cannot be forced to do that either before the\ntrial,  or  during  the  trial.    The  principle  comes  to  us\nthrough  the  English  law,  and  its  roots  go  far  back  in\nhistory.  Wigmore, in his book on  Evidence (vol IV, sec.\n2250) traces very accurately the genesis, and indicates the\nlimits  of  the  privilege.  And  he  shows  that,  however\nimportant the doctrine may be, it is necessary to confine\nit  within  its  proper  limits.    What  the  rule  forbids  is\ncompelling  a  man  to  give  evidence  which  incriminates\nhimself.\"\n\n[32] In R v Gumede and Another 1942 AD 398, 412-4, Feetham JA\n\nreferred  to  the  embodiment  of  the  rule  in  the  Criminal\n\nProcedure and Evidence Act 1917, and  noted that its first\n\n\f31\n\nappearance in South Africa was in Ordinance No 72 of 1830\n\nof the Cape of Good Hope. There was no doubt, he said, that\n\nthe Ordinance was intended to apply to the Cape Colony the\n\ncommon law of England in regard to the  burden of proof\n\nresting on the prosecution when asking a criminal court to\n\nadmit a confession alleged to have been made by an accused\n\nperson. He cited the cases of R v Warwickshall, supra and\n\nIbrahim v R, supra,  as did Nicholas AJA, in his detailed\n\nexamination of the rule in S v de Vries, supra, 232-4.\n\n[33] The conclusion which I reach, as a result of this survey,\n\nis  that  the  common  law  rule  in  regard  to  the  burden  of\n\nproving  that  a  confession  was  voluntary  has  been  not  a\n\nfortuitous but an integral and essential part of the right\n\nto  remain  silent  after  arrest,  the  right  not  to  be\n\ncompelled to make a confession, and the right not to be a\n\ncompellable  witness  against  oneself.    These  rights,  in\n\nturn, are the necessary reinforcement of Viscount Sankey's\n\n\"golden thread\" - that it is for the prosecution to prove\n\nthe  guilt  of  the  accused  beyond  reasonable  doubt\n\n(Woolmington's case, supra).  Reverse the burden of proof\n\nand  all  these  rights  are  seriously  compromised  and\n\nundermined.  I therefore consider that the common law rule\n\non  the  burden  of  proof  is  inherent  in  the  rights\n\nspecifically mentioned in section 25(2) and (3)(c) and (d),\n\n\f32\n\nand  forms  part  of  the  right  to  a  fair  trial.      In  so\n\ninterpreting these provisions of the Constitution I have\n\ntaken account of the historical background, and comparable\n\nforeign case law.  I believe too that this interpretation\n\npromotes the values which underlie an open and democratic\n\nsociety  and  is  entirely  consistent  with  the  language  of\n\nsection 25.  It follows that section 217(1)(b)(ii) violates\n\nthese provisions of the Constitution.\n\n[34] I should add that I prefer not to consider in this judgment\n\nthe meaning and scope of the right to silence during trial.\n\nIt is unnecessary to decide whether section 217(1)(b)(ii)\n\nviolates that right.\n\n[35] The  State  submitted,  in  the  alternative,  that  if  the\n\nproviso in question is a violation of fundamental rights,\n\nit  is  one  which  is  saved  by  section  33(1)  of  the\n\nConstitution.    The  proviso,  it  was  argued,  was  a  law  of\n\ngeneral  application  which  was  (i)  reasonable,  (ii)\n\njustifiable  in  an  open  and  democratic  society  based  on\n\nfreedom  and  equality,  under  paragraph  (a)  of  the  sub-\n\nsection and was also \"necessary\" in terms of paragraph (b).\n\nMuch written and oral argument was addressed to us on the\n\nCanadian approach to the broadly  analogous provision in\n\nsection  1  of  the  Canadian  Charter,  which  guarantees  the\n\n\f33\n\nrights and freedoms set out in that document\n\n\"subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law\nas can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic\nsociety\".\n\nThe  Canadian  courts  have  evolved  certain  criteria,  in\n\napplying this section, such as the existence of substantial\n\nand  pressing  public  needs  which  are  met  by  the  impugned\n\nstatute.  There,  if  the  statutory  violation  is  to  be\n\njustified it must also pass a \"proportionality\" test, which\n\nthe courts dissect into several components.   See, e.g. R\n\nv Chaulk (1991) 1 CRR (2d) 1.   These criteria may well be\n\nof  assistance  to  our  courts  in  cases  where  a  delicate\n\nbalancing of individual rights against social interests is\n\nrequired.   But section 33(1) itself sets out the criteria\n\nwhich we are to apply, and I see no reason, in this case at\n\nleast,  to  attempt  to  fit  our  analysis  into  the  Canadian\n\npattern.\n\n[36] As  to  reasonableness  I  am  prepared  to  assume  that  the\n\npresumption passes the \"rational connection\" test, although\n\nI am not convinced of this.  But that does not in itself\n\nexplain why it should be thought reasonable to undermine a\n\nlong-established and now entrenched right.  The tests of\n\nreasonableness,  justifiability  and  necessity  are  not\n\nidentical, and in applying each of them individually one\n\nwill  not  always  get  the  same  result.    But  in  this\n\n\f34\n\nparticular  instance  reasonableness,  justification  and\n\nnecessity  may  be  looked  at  and  assessed  together.    The\n\nState's problems here are manifold.  The rights interfered\n\nwith  are  fundamental  to  our  concepts  of  justice  and\n\nforensic fairness.  They have existed in this country for\n\nover 150 years.  A drastic consequence of the alteration to\n\nthe  law  brought  about  by  section  217(1)(b)(ii)  is  the\n\npossibility  that  an  accused  may  be  convicted  over  the\n\nreasonable doubt of the court.  Nor has it been shown that\n\nit is in practice impossible or unduly burdensome for the\n\nState to discharge its onus; it has done so successfully in\n\ninnumerable  trials  under  the  common  law  rule.    The\n\ncircumstances in which an accused person agreed to make a\n\nconfession  are  not  peculiarly  within  his  or  her  own\n\nknowledge.  What then is the rationale of the proviso?  The\n\nanswer, it seems (and we have been given no other) lies in\n\nthe Report of the Botha Commission into criminal procedure\n\nand evidence (RP 78/1971).   The extract I quote here is\n\ntaken from the written submissions on behalf of the accused\n\nin this case.\n\n\"5.31.3.  It  is  however  a  disquieting  phenomenon  that\naccused  persons,  after  having  made  a  confession  to  a\nmagistrate which was confirmed and reduced to writing in\nthe presence of a magistrate or justice, far too frequently\nand sometimes under the influence of others and in spite of\ntheir contrary allegations to the magistrate or justice,\nallege  at  their  trial  that  the  confession  was  in  fact\nimproperly obtained from them and is therefore inadmissible\nin  evidence  with  the  result  that,  notwithstanding  the\naccused's erstwhile allegations, the admissibility thereof\nhas, far too frequently, to be determined at an extended\nhearing where the onus rests upon the State throughout.  As\na judicial officer a magistrate is peculiarly equipped and\n\n\f35\n\nable,  with  the  aid  of  his  personal  observation  and\npreceding  interrogation  of  the  person  who  makes  the\nconfession, to come to a prima facie conclusion in regard\nto the question whether the confession was or is being made\nfreely  and  voluntarily  by  such  person  in  his  sound  and\nsober senses without having been unduly influenced thereto,\nand it is highly improbable that a magistrate would take a\nconfession  from  someone  unless  he  is  convinced  of  the\nexistence  of  the  prescribed  requirements  for  the\nadmissibility thereof.  In view of these considerations,\nand  to  give  meaning  to  the  making  or  confirmation  of  a\nconfession  to  or  in  the  presence  of  a  magistrate,  the\nCommission is of the opinion that, where a confession was\nmade to a magistrate and reduced to writing, or confirmed\nand reduced to writing in the presence of a magistrate, it\nshould at the trial of that person for an offence to which\nthe  confession  relates,  be  presumed,  unless  that  person\nproved  the  contrary  (that  is  to  say,  on  a  balance  of\nprobabilities)  that  the  confession  was  made  freely  and\nvoluntarily by such person in his sound and sober senses\nwithout  having  been  unduly  influenced  thereto.    The\nCommission therefore recommends that a further proviso to\nthis effect be added to section 244(1) with reference to a\nconfession made to a magistrate or confirmed and reduced to\nwriting in the presence of a magistrate.  Such a provision\nwould considerably shorten and may eliminate the extent of\nthe so called trials within a trial.\"\n\nIt appears from this passage that the harm which the new\n\nproviso was intended to overcome was twofold.  First, some\n\naccused  attempt  dishonestly  to  retract  confessions  which\n\nthey have made before a magistrate.  Second, this leads to\n\nunduly long trials within trials.  The justification of the\n\namendment,  therefore,  was  that  it  would  make  it  more\n\ndifficult  for  the  dishonest  accused  to  make  false\n\nallegations of duress, and that this would shorten trials.\n\n[37] As  to  the  first  head  of  justification,  the  objective  is\n\nlaudable.    But  the  reasoning  of  the  Commission  seems  to\n\noverlook the interests of an accused who has in fact been\n\nsubject to duress.  The Commission itself, in para 5.23 of\n\nits  Report,  recognised  that  an  apparently  voluntary\n\n\f36\n\nconfirmation of a confession before a magistrate \"may be\n\nmisleading,  where  the  confession  was  in  fact  forced\n\nbeforehand by improper interrogation or inducement by the\n\npolice.\"  There is nothing before this Court to show that\n\nthe  common  law  rule  caused  substantial  harm  to  the\n\nadministration of justice.  The Commission points to the\n\nimprobability of a magistrate taking a confession unless\n\nconvinced  of  its  voluntariness.      That  may  well  be  an\n\nimprobability in most cases, but why that should justify\n\nplacing a burden of proof on the accused I am unable to\n\nfollow.  That improbability has always weighed  against an\n\naccused and will continue to do so, without resort to the\n\nproviso.    In  any  event  there  is  nothing  in  the  Criminal\n\nProcedure  Act  which  obliges  a  magistrate  to  conduct  any\n\nparticular  preliminary  enquiry  into  voluntariness.    Some\n\nAttorneys-General  and  magistrates  have  drafted  helpful\n\nquestionnaires for the use of magistrates or justices of\n\nthe peace before recording a confession.  But there is no\n\nstandard form and none with statutory provenance.\n\n[38] The reverse onus may in some cases obviate or shorten the\n\ntrial within a trial.  Those of my colleagues on the Court\n\nwho have had  considerable experience of criminal trials\n\ndoubt that is so.  Even if it were the case, and even if it\n\ndid release police or prosecution from the inconvenience of\n\n\f37\n\nmarshalling and calling their witnesses before the accused\n\ngave  evidence,  I  cannot  regard  those  inconveniences  as\n\noutweighing and justifying the substantial infringement of\n\nthe important rights which I have identified.  The argument\n\nfrom convenience would only have merit in situations where\n\naccused  persons  plainly  have  more  convenient  access  to\n\nproof, and where the reversed burden does not create undue\n\nhardship or unfairness.   Cf R v Oakes (1983) 3 CRR  289,\n\n304, per Martin JA in the Ontario Court of Appeal.  That is\n\nnot the case here.\n\n[39] Accordingly, section 217(b)(ii) does not meet the criteria\n\nlaid  down  in  section  33(1)  of  the  Constitution.    It  is\n\ninconsistent with the Constitution and in terms of section\n\n98(5) of the Constitution, it must be declared invalid.\n\n[40] It follows that in my opinion the ruling given by Levinsohn\n\nJ in S v Shangase and Another 1994(2) BCLR 42(D); 1995(1)\n\nSA 425(D) was correct. \n\n[41] It is important, I believe, to emphasise what this judgment\n\ndoes  not  decide.    It  does  not  decide  that  all  statutory\n\nprovisions which create presumptions in criminal cases are\n\ninvalid.  This Court recognises the pressing social need\n\nfor the effective prosecution of crime, and that in some\n\n\f38\n\ncases the prosecution may require reasonable presumptions\n\nto assist it in this task.  Presumptions are of different\n\ntypes.    Some  are  no  more  than  evidential  presumptions,\n\nwhich give certain prosecution evidence the status of prima\n\nfacie  proof,  requiring  the  accused  to  do  no  more  than\n\nproduce credible evidence which casts doubt on the  prima\n\nfacie proof.  See e.g. the presumptions in section 212 of\n\nthe Criminal Procedure Act.  This judgment does not relate\n\nto  such  presumptions.      Nor  does  it  seek  to  invalidate\n\nevery legal presumption reversing the onus of proof.  Some\n\nmay  be  justifiable  as  being  rational  in  themselves,\n\nrequiring an accused person to prove only facts to which he\n\nor she has easy access, and which it would be unreasonable\n\nto expect the prosecution to disprove.   The provisions in\n\nsection 237 of the Act (evidence on charge of bigamy) may\n\nbe of this type.  Or there may be presumptions which are\n\nnecessary  if  certain  offences  are  to  be  effectively\n\nprosecuted,  and  the  State  is  able  to  show  that  for  good\n\nreason  it  cannot  be  expected  to  produce  the  evidence\n\nitself.    The  presumption  that  a  person  who  habitually\n\nconsorts  with  prostitutes  is  living  off  the  proceeds  of\n\nprostitution was upheld on that basis in R v Downey supra\n\nby the Supreme Court of Canada.  A similar presumption in\n\na United Kingdom statute was upheld by the European Court\n\nof  Human  Rights  in  X  v  United  Kingdom  (Application  No\n\n\f39\n\n5124/71, Collection of Decisions, ECHR 135).  This is not\n\nsuch a case.  Nor does this judgment deal with statutory\n\nprovisions  which  are  in  form  presumptions  but  which  in\n\neffect  create  new  offences.      See  Attorney-General  v\n\nOdendaal 1982 Botswana LR 194, 226-7.\n\n[42] I would also make clear that this judgment does not purport\n\nto apply to exceptions, exemptions or provisos to statutory\n\noffences,  referred  to  in  section  90  of  the  Criminal\n\nProcedure Act and in the extensive case law on that section\n\nand its predecessors.  Nor, of course, does it deal with\n\nthe factors governing the creation of offences of strict\n\nliability,  discussed  in  Amalgamated  Beverage  Industries\n\nNatal (Pty) Ltd v Durban City Council 1994(3) SA 170 and\n\n646(A), although the considerations weighed in that case\n\nmay not be irrelevant to the constitutional validity of \n\ncertain statutory presumptions. \n\n[43] It is necessary, finally, to consider what order, if any,\n\nshould  be  made  under  section  98(6)  of  the  Constitution\n\nconsequent upon the finding of invalidity.  The terms of\n\nthat sub-section are as follows -\n\n\"(6) Unless the Constitutional Court in the interests of\njustice and good government orders otherwise, and save to\nthe extent that it so orders, the declaration of invalidity\nof a law or a provision thereof -\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n40\n\nexisting  at  the  commencement  of  this\nConstitution,  shall  not  invalidate  anything\ndone or permitted in terms thereof before the\ncoming  into  effect  of  such  declaration  of\ninvalidity ;or\n\nafter \n\npassed \nshall\ninvalidate  everything  done  or  permitted  in\nterms thereof.\n\ncommencement, \n\nsuch \n\nParagraph  (a)  of  the  sub-section  applies  in  this  case.\n\nAbsent a specific order by this Court, any decision by a\n\ntrial court admitting a confession in reliance on section\n\n217(1)(b)(ii), given before the date of the declaration of\n\nits invalidity, would stand.  This would be unfortunate for\n\nsome  accused  persons.    But  if  we  were  to  give  our\n\ndeclaration full retrospective effect in terms of section\n\n98(6)  so  as  to  invalidate  such  earlier  rulings  on\n\nadmissibility  the  likely  result  of  such  order  would  be\n\nnumerous  appeals  with  the  possibility  of  proceedings  de\n\nnovo under sections 313 or 324 of the Criminal Procedure\n\nAct.  In  proceedings  de  novo  the  necessary  evidence  of\n\nvoluntariness may no longer be available.  Paragraph (a) of\n\nsection 98(6) is intended to ensure that the invalidation\n\nof a statute existing at the date of commencement of the\n\nConstitution should not ordinarily have any retrospective\n\neffect, so as to avoid the dislocation and inconvenience of\n\nundoing transactions, decisions or actions taken under that\n\nstatute.    This  Court's  power  to  order  otherwise  in  the\n\ninterests  of  justice  and  good  government  should  be\n\nexercised circumspectly.  In some cases (and I believe that\n\n\f41\n\nthis is one of them) the interests of individuals must be\n\nweighed against the interest of avoiding dislocation to the\n\nadministration of justice and the desirability of a smooth\n\ntransition  from  the  old  to  the  new.  We  should  also  take\n\ninto  account  the  fact  that  hitherto  the  police  and\n\nprosecution \n\nhave \n\nlegitimately \n\nrelied \n\non \n\nsection\n\n217(1)(b)(ii).    Cf.  the  approach  of  the  United  States\n\nSupreme Court in such cases as Linkletter v Walker 381 US\n\n618 (1965) and Stovall v Denno 388 US 293 (1967). \n\n[44] The application of section 217(1)(b)(ii) since 27th April,\n\n1994 may well have caused injustice to accused persons, but\n\nwe cannot repair all past injustice by a simple stroke of\n\nthe pen.  Weighing all the relevant considerations it seems\n\nto me that the proper balance can be struck by invalidating\n\nthe  admission  of  any  confession  in  reliance  on  section\n\n217(1)(b)(ii) before the date of our declaration, but in\n\nrespect only of trials begun on or after 27th April, 1994,\n\nand not completed at the date of delivery of this judgment.\n\nThe  effect  might  be  in  those  trials  to  require\n\nreconsideration of the admissibility of confessions already\n\nadmitted,  including  the  hearing  of  further  evidence. \n\nWhether  an  order  under  section  98(6)  may  or  should\n\nencompass proceedings which were pending before 27th April,\n\n1994,  depends  on  the  proper  interpretation  of  section\n\n\f42\n\n241(8) of the Constitution.  As indicated at the beginning\n\nof the judgment, that issue is deferred for determination\n\nin the Mhlungu case.   \n\n[45] In the present case the trial judge has given no decision\n\non the admissibility of the confessions, so that no special\n\norder need be made in respect of it.\n\n[46] In conclusion, we should like to express our indebtedness\n\nto Mr A Findlay S.C. and his colleagues, of the Durban Bar,\n\nwho appeared for the accused persons at the request of the\n\nCourt.\n\nThe following order is accordingly made :-\n\n1\n\n2\n\nIt is declared that section 217(1)(b)(ii) of the\nCriminal Procedure Act, 1977, is invalid.\n\nIn terms of sub-section (6) of section 98 of the\nConstitution it is ordered that this declaration\nshall  invalidate  any  application  of  the  said\nsection 217(1)(b)(ii) in any criminal trial which\ncommenced  on  or  after  27th  April,  1994,  and  in\nwhich  the  verdict  has  not  at  the  date  of  this\norder been given. \n\n______________________________\nS.KENTRIDGE\nACTING JUDGE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT\n\nWe concur in the judgement of Kentridge AJ:\n\n     \n\nChaskalson P\n\n\f  \n\nAckermann J\n\nDidcott J\n\nKriegler J\n     \n  \nLanga J\n\nMadala J\n\nMahomed J\n\nMokgoro J\n\nO'Regan J\n\nSachs J\n\nCASE NO\n\n43\n\n:\n\nCCT/5/94 \n\nCOUNSEL FOR APPLICANT \n:    A.

They appealed to the Appellate Division of the \nSupreme Court against the convictions and sentences.  The Appellate Division \ndismissed the appeals against the convictions and came to the conclusion that the \ncircumstances of the murders were such that the accused should receive the heaviest \nsentence permissible according to law. \n\n \n[2] \n\n \n \n\nSection 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act No. 51 of 1977 prescribes that the \ndeath penalty is a competent sentence for murder.  Counsel for the accused was \ninvited by the Appellate Division to consider whether this provision was consistent \nwith the Republic of South Africa Constitution, 1993, which had come into force \nsubsequent to the conviction and sentence by the trial court.  He argued that it was \nnot, contending that it was in conflict with the provisions of sections 9 and 11(2) of \n\n1 \n\n\fthe Constitution. \n\nThe Appellate Division dismissed the appeals against the sentences on the counts of \nattempted murder and robbery, but postponed the further hearing of the appeals \nagainst the death sentence until the constitutional issues are decided by this Court.  \nSee:  S v Makwanyane en \u2018n Ander 1994 (3) SA 868 (A).  Two issues were raised:  \nthe constitutionality of section 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act, and the \nimplications of section 241(8) of the Constitution.  Although there was no formal \nreference of these issues to this Court in terms of section 102(6) of the Constitution, \nthat was implicit in the judgment of the Appellate Division, and was treated as such \nby the parties. \n\nThe trial was concluded before the 1993 Constitution came into force, and so the \nquestion of the constitutionality of the death sentence did not arise at the trial.  \nBecause evidence which might possibly be relevant to that issue would not have been \nled, we asked counsel appearing before this Court to consider whether evidence, other \nthan undisputed information placed before us in argument, would be relevant to the \ndetermination of the question referred to us by the Appellate Division.  Apart from \nthe issue of public opinion, with which I will deal later in this judgment, counsel were \nnot able to point to specific material that had not already been placed before us which \nmight be relevant to the decision on the constitutional issues raised in this case.  I am \nsatisfied that no good purpose would be served by referring the case back to the trial \ncourt for the hearing of further evidence and that we should deal with the matter on \nthe basis of the information and arguments that have been presented to us. \n\nIt would no doubt have been better if the framers of the Constitution had stated \nspecifically, either that the death sentence is not a competent penalty, or that it is \npermissible in circumstances sanctioned by law.  This, however, was not done and it \nhas been left to this Court to decide whether the penalty is consistent with the \nprovisions of the Constitution.  That is the extent and limit of the Court's power in this \ncase. \n\n2 \n\n \n[3] \n\n \n[4] \n\n \n[5] \n\n \n \n \n\n\f[6] \n\nNo executions have taken place in South Africa since 1989.1 There are apparently \nover 300 persons, and possibly as many as 400 if persons sentenced in the former \nTranskei, Bophuthatswana and Venda are taken into account, who have been \nsentenced to death by the Courts and who are on death row waiting for this issue to be \nresolved.  Some of these convictions date back to 1988, and approximately half of the \npersons on death row were sentenced more than two years ago.2  This is an intolerable \nsituation and it is essential that it be resolved one way or another without further \ndelay.3 \n\nThe Relevant Provisions of the Constitution \n \n[7] \n \n\nThe Constitution \n\n                                                 \n     1 The last execution in South Africa occurred on 14 November 1989.  See infra note 26. \n\n     2 This information was contained in the written argument filed on behalf of the South African Government \nand was not disputed. \n\n     3 The mental anguish suffered by convicted persons awaiting the death sentence is well documented.  A \nprolonged delay in the execution of a death sentence may in itself be cause for the invalidation of a sentence of \ndeath that was lawfully imposed.  In India, Zimbabwe and Jamaica, where the death sentence is not \nunconstitutional, sentences of death have been set aside on these grounds.  The relevant authorities are collected \nand discussed by Gubbay CJ in Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe v Attorney-General, \nZimbabwe and Others 1993 (4) SA 239 (ZSC), and by Lord Griffiths in Pratt v Attorney-General for Jamaica \n[1993] 3 WLR 995 (JPC). \n\n \n \n\n3 \n\n\f... provides a historic bridge between the past of a deeply divided society \ncharacterised by strife, conflict, untold suffering and injustice, and a future \nfounded on the recognition of human rights, democracy and peaceful co-existence \nand development opportunities for all South Africans, irrespective of colour, race, \nclass, belief or sex.4 \n\nIt is a transitional constitution but one which itself establishes a new order in South \nAfrica; an order in which human rights and democracy are entrenched and in which \nthe Constitution: \n\n... shall be the supreme law of the Republic and any law or act inconsistent with its \nprovisions shall, unless otherwise provided expressly or by necessary implication in \nthis Constitution, be of no force and effect to the extent of the inconsistency.5 \n\nChapter Three of the Constitution sets out the fundamental rights to which every \nperson is entitled under the Constitution and also contains provisions dealing with the \nway in which the Chapter is to be interpreted by the Courts. It does not deal \nspecifically with the death penalty, but in section 11(2), it prohibits \"cruel, inhuman \nor degrading treatment or punishment.\"  There is no definition of what is to be \nregarded as \"cruel, inhuman or degrading\" and we therefore have to give meaning to \nthese words ourselves. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n[8] \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     4 These words are taken from the first paragraph of the provision on National Unity and Reconciliation with \nwhich the Constitution concludes. Section 232(4) provides that for the purposes of interpreting the Constitution, \nthis  provision  shall be deemed to be part of the substance of the Constitution, and shall not have a lesser status \nthan any other provision of the Constitution. \n\n     5 Section 4(1) of the Constitution. \n\n \n \n\n4 \n\n\f[9] \n\nIn S v Zuma and Two Others,6 this Court dealt with the approach to be adopted in the \ninterpretation of the fundamental rights enshrined in Chapter Three of the \nConstitution.  It gave its approval to an approach which, whilst paying due regard to \nthe language that has been used, is \"generous\" and \"purposive\" and gives expression \nto the underlying values of the Constitution.  Kentridge AJ, who delivered the \njudgment of the Court, referred with approval7 to the following passage in the \nCanadian case of  R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe meaning of a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter was to be ascertained \nby an analysis of the purpose of such a guarantee; it was to be understood, in other \nwords, in the light of the interests it was meant to protect. \n\nIn my view this analysis is to be undertaken, and the purpose of the right or \nfreedom in question is to be sought by reference to the character and larger objects \nof the Charter itself, to the language chosen to articulate the specific right or \nfreedom, to the historical origins of the concept enshrined, and where applicable, \nto the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights and freedoms with which it \nis associated within the text of the Charter.  The interpretation should be...a \ngenerous rather than legalistic one, aimed at fulfilling the purpose of a guarantee \nand securing for individuals the full benefit of the Charter's protection.8 \n\n                                                 \n     6 Constitutional Court Case No. CCT/5/94 (5 April 1995). \n\n     7 Id. at para. 15. \n\n     8 (1985) 13 CRR 64 at 103.  As O'Regan J points out in her concurring judgment, there may possibly be \ninstances where the \"generous\" and \"purposive\" interpretations do not coincide.  That problem does not arise in \nthe present case. \n\n \n \n\n5 \n\n\f[10]  Without seeking in any way to qualify anything that was said in Zuma's case, I need \nsay no more in this judgment than that section 11(2) of the Constitution must not be \nconstrued in isolation, but in its context, which includes the history and background to \nthe adoption of the Constitution, other provisions of the Constitution itself and, in \nparticular, the provisions of Chapter Three of which it is part.9  It must also be \nconstrued in a way which secures for \"individuals the full measure\" of its protection.10 \n Rights with which section 11(2) is associated in Chapter Three of the Constitution, \nand which are of particular importance to a decision on the constitutionality of the \ndeath penalty are included in section 9, \"every person shall have the right to life\", \nsection 10, \"every person shall have the right to respect for and protection of his or \nher dignity\", and section 8, \"every person shall have the right to equality before the \nlaw and to equal protection of the law.\"  Punishment must meet the requirements of \nsections 8, 9 and 10; and this is so, whether these sections are treated as giving \nmeaning to Section 11(2) or as prescribing separate and independent standards with \nwhich all punishments must comply.11 \n\n \n[11]  Mr. Bizos, who represented the South African government at the hearing of this \nmatter, informed us that the government accepts that the death penalty is a cruel, \ninhuman and degrading punishment and that it should be declared unconstitutional. \nThe Attorney General of the Witwatersrand, whose office is independent of the \ngovernment, took a different view, and contended that the death penalty is a necessary \nand acceptable form of punishment and that it is not cruel, inhuman or degrading \nwithin the meaning of section 11(2).  He argued that if the framers of the Constitution \nhad wished to make the death penalty unconstitutional they would have said so, and \n\n                                                 \n     9 Jaga v D\u00f6nges, N.O. and Another 1950 (4) SA 653 (A) at 662-663.   \n\n     10 Minister of Home Affairs (Bermuda) v Fisher [1980] AC 319 (PC) at 328-329.   \n\n     11 In the analysis that follows sections 8, 9 and 10 are treated together as giving meaning to section 11(2), \nwhich is the provision of Chapter Three that deals specifically with punishment. \n\n \n \n\n6 \n\n\fthat their failure to do so indicated an intention to leave the issue open to be dealt with \nby Parliament in the ordinary way.  It was for Parliament, and not the government, to \ndecide whether or not the death penalty should be repealed, and Parliament had not \ntaken such a decision.  \n\n \nLegislative History \n \n[12]  The written argument of the South African government deals with the debate which \n\ntook place in regard to the death penalty before the commencement of the \nconstitutional negotiations.  The information that it placed before us was not disputed. \n It was argued that this background information forms part of the context within \nwhich the Constitution should be interpreted.  \n\n \n[13]  Our Courts have held that it is permissible in interpreting a statute to have regard to \n\nthe purpose and background of the legislation in question. \n\n \n\nCertainly no less important than the oft repeated statement that the words and \nexpressions used in a statute must be interpreted according to their ordinary \nmeaning is the statement that they must be interpreted in the light of their context.  \nBut it may be useful to stress two points in relation to the application of this \nprinciple.  The first is that \"the context\", as here used, is not limited to the \nlanguage of the rest of the statute regarded as throwing light of a dictionary kind \non the part to be interpreted.  Often of more importance is the matter of the statute, \nits apparent scope and purpose, and, within limits, its background.12  \n\n \n[14]  Debates in Parliament, including statements made by Ministers responsible for \n\nlegislation, and explanatory memoranda providing reasons for new bills have not been \nadmitted as background material. It is, however, permissible to take notice of the \nreport of a judicial commission of enquiry for the limited purpose of ascertaining  \"the \nmischief aimed at [by] the statutory enactment in question.\"13  These principles were \n\n                                                 \n     12 Per Schreiner JA in Jaga v D\u00f6nges, N.O. and Another, supra note 9, at 662G-H. \n\n     13 Attorney-General, Eastern Cape v Blom and Others 1988 (4) SA 645 (A) at 668H-669F;  Westinghouse \nBrake & Equipment (Pty) Ltd v Bilger Engineering (Pty) Ltd 1986(2) SA 555(A) at 562C-563A. \n \n \n\n7 \n\n\fderived in part from English law.  In England, the courts have recently relaxed this \nexclusionary rule and have held, in Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v Hart14 that, subject \nto the privileges of the House of Commons: \n\n...reference to Parliamentary material should be permitted as an aid to the \nconstruction of legislation which is ambiguous or obscure or the literal meaning of \nwhich leads to an absurdity.  Even in such cases references in court to Parliamentary \nmaterial should only be permitted where such material clearly discloses the mischief \naimed at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words.15 \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     14 1993 AC 593 HL (E). \n\n     15 Per Lord Browne-Wilkinson at 634D-E, who went on to say that \"as at present advised I cannot foresee \nthat any statement other than the statement of the Minister or other promoter of the Bill is likely to meet these \ncriteria\". \n\n \n \n\n8 \n\n\f[15]  As the judgment in Pepper's case shows, a similar relaxation of the exclusionary rule \n\nhas apparently taken place in Australia and New Zealand.16  Whether our Courts \nshould follow these examples and extend the scope of what is admissible as \nbackground material for the purpose of interpreting statutes does not arise in the \npresent case.  We are concerned with the interpretation of the Constitution, and not \nthe interpretation of ordinary legislation.  A constitution is no ordinary statute.  It is \nthe source of legislative and executive authority.  It determines how the country is to \nbe governed and how legislation is to be enacted.  It defines the powers of the \ndifferent organs of State, including Parliament, the executive, and the courts as well \nas the fundamental rights of every person which must be respected in exercising such \npowers. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     16 Id. at 637 F. \n\n \n \n\n9 \n\n\f[16] \n\nIn countries in which the constitution is similarly the supreme law, it is not unusual \nfor the courts to have regard to the circumstances existing at the time the constitution \nwas adopted, including the debates and writings which formed part of the process.  \nThe United States Supreme Court pays attention to such matters, and its judgments \nfrequently contain reviews of the legislative history of the provision in question, \nincluding references to debates, and statements made, at the time the provision was \nadopted.17  The German Constitutional Court also has regard to such evidence.18  The \nCanadian Supreme Court has held such evidence to be admissible, and has referred to \nthe historical background including the pre-confederation debates for the purpose of \ninterpreting provisions of the Canadian Constitution, although it attaches less weight \nto such information than the United States Supreme Court does.19  It also has regard \nto ministerial statements in Parliament in regard to the purpose of particular \nlegislation.20  In India, whilst speeches of individual members of Parliament or the \nConvention are apparently not ordinarily admissible, the reports of drafting \ncommittees can, according to Seervai, \"be a helpful extrinsic aid to construction.\"21  \nSeervai cites Kania CJ in A. K. Gopalan v The State22 for the proposition that whilst \nnot taking \"...into consideration the individual opinions of Members of Parliament or \nConvention to construe the meaning of a particular clause, when a question is raised \nwhether a certain phrase or expression was up for consideration at all or not, a \nreference to debates may be permitted.\"  The European Court of Human Rights and \nthe United Nations Committee on Human Rights all allow their deliberations to be \n\n                                                 \n     17 ROTUNDA AND NOWAK, TREATISE ON CONSTITUTIONAL LAW:  SUBSTANCE AND PROCEDURE \u00a723.6 (2d ed. \n1992). \n\n     18 In the decision on the constitutionality of life imprisonment, [1977] 45 BVerfGE 187, the German Federal \nConstitutional Court took into account that life imprisonment was seen by the framers of the constitution as the \nalternative to the death sentence when they decided to abolish capital punishment.

The final draft adopted by the forum of the Multi-Party \nNegotiating Process was, with few changes, adopted by Parliament.  The Multi-Party \nNegotiating Process was advised by technical committees, and the reports of these \ncommittees on the drafts are the equivalent of the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires, relied upon \nby the international tribunals.  Such background material can provide a context for the \ninterpretation of the Constitution and, where it serves that purpose, I can see no \nreason why such evidence should be excluded.  The precise nature of the evidence, \nand the purpose for which it may be tendered, will determine the weight to be given \nto it. \n\n \n[18] \n \n\nIt has been said in respect of the Canadian constitution that: \n\n                                                 \n     23 Article 32 of the Vienna Convention of Treaties 1969, 8 ILM 679 (1969) permits the use of travaux \npr\u00e9paratoires for the purpose of interpreting treaties.  For examples of the application of this principle, see Keith \nCox v Canada, United Nations Committee on Human Rights, Communication No. 539/1993, 3 November 1993, \nat 19, stating: \n \n\nNonetheless, when giving a broad interpretation to any human rights treaty, care must be \ntaken not to frustrate or circumvent the ascertainable will of the drafters.  Here the rules of \ninterpretation set forth in article 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties help \nus by allowing the use of the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires. \n\n \nNg v Canada, United Nations Committee on Human Rights, Communication No 469/1991, 5 November 1993, at \n9; Young, James and Webster v United Kingdom (1981) 3 EHRR 20, para. 166; Lithgow v United Kingdom \n(1986) 8 EHRR 329, para. 117; and more generally J.G. STARKE, INTRODUCTION TO INTERNATIONAL LAW 481 \n(10th ed., Butterworths)(1989). \n\n \n \n\n11 \n\n\f...the Charter is not the product of a few individual public servants, however \ndistinguished, but of a multiplicity of individuals who played major roles in the \nnegotiating, drafting and adoption of the Charter.  How can one say with any \nconfidence that within this enormous multiplicity of actors ... the comments of a few \nfederal civil servants can in any way be determinative.24 \n\n \n\nOur Constitution is also the product of a multiplicity of persons, some of whom took \n\npart in the \nnegotiations, and \nothers who as \nmembers of \nParliament \nenacted the final \ndraft.  The same \ncaution is called \nfor in respect of \nthe comments of \nindividual actors \nin the process, no \nmatter how \nprominent a role \nthey might have \nplayed.    \n\n \n[19]  Background evidence may, however, be useful to show why particular provisions \n\nwere or were not included in the Constitution.  It is neither necessary nor desirable at \nthis stage in the development of our constitutional law to express any opinion on \nwhether it might also be relevant for other purposes, nor to attempt to lay down \ngeneral principles governing the admissibility of such evidence.  It is sufficient to say \nthat where the background material is clear, is not in dispute, and is relevant to \n\n                                                 \n     24 Reference re s.94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act (British Columbia), supra note 19, at 49. \n\n \n \n\n12 \n\n\fshowing why particular provisions were or were not included in the Constitution, it \ncan be taken into account by a Court in interpreting the Constitution.  These \nconditions are satisfied in the present case. \n\n \n[20]  Capital punishment was the subject of debate before and during the constitution-\n\nmaking process, and it is clear that the failure to deal specifically in the Constitution \nwith this issue was not accidental.25 \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     25 The brief account that follows is taken from the written submissions of the South African Government.  \nThese facts were not disputed at the hearing. \n \n\n \n \n\n13 \n\n\f[21] \n\n \n[22] \n\nIn February 1990, Mr F W de Klerk, then President of the Republic of South Africa, \nstated in Parliament that \"the death penalty had been the subject of intensive \ndiscussion in recent months\", which had led to concrete proposals for reform under \nwhich the death penalty should be retained as an option to be used in \"extreme cases\", \nthe judicial discretion in regard to the imposition of the death sentence should be \nbroadened, and an automatic right of appeal allowed to those under sentence of \ndeath.26  These proposals were later enacted into law by the Criminal Law \nAmendment Act No. 107 of 1990. \n\nIn August 1991, the South African Law Commission in its Interim Report on Group \nand Human Rights described the imposition of the death penalty as \"highly \ncontroversial\".27  A working paper of the Commission which preceded the Interim \nReport had proposed that the right to life be recognised in a bill of rights, subject to \nthe proviso that the discretionary imposition of the sentence of death be allowed for \nthe most serious crimes.  As a result of the comments it  received, the Law \nCommission decided to change the draft and to adopt a \"Solomonic solution\"28 under \nwhich a constitutional court would be required to decide whether a right to life \nexpressed in unqualified terms could be circumscribed by a limitations clause \n\n                                                 \n     26 Address to Parliament on 2 February 1990.  In this speech it was said that the last execution in South \nAfrica had been on 14 November 1989. \n\n     27 South African Law Commission, Interim Report on Group and Human Rights, Project 58, August 1991, \npara. 7.31. \n\n     28 \"The Commission ... considers that a Solomonic solution is necessary:  a middle course between the \nretention of capital punishment and the abolition thereof must be chosen in the proposed bill of rights.\" Id. at \n7.33. \n\n \n \n\n14 \n\n\fcontained in a bill of rights.29  \"This proposed solution\" it said \"naturally imposes an \nonerous task on the Constitutional Court.  But it is a task which this Court will in \nfuture have to carry out in respect of many other laws and executive and \nadministrative acts.  The Court must not shrink from this task, otherwise we shall be \nback to parliamentary sovereignty.\"30 \n\nIn March 1992, the then Minister of Justice issued a press statement in which he said: \n  \n\n \n \n[23] \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     29 Id. at para. 7.36. \n\n     30 Id. at para. 7.37. \n\n \n \n\n15 \n\n\fOpinions regarding the death penalty differ substantially.  There are those who feel \nthat the death penalty is a cruel and inhuman form of punishment.  Others are of \nthe opinion that it is in some extreme cases the community's only effective \nsafeguard against violent crime and that it gives effect in such cases to the \nretributive and deterrent purposes of punishment.31 \n\nHe went on to say that policy in regard to the death penalty might be settled during \nnegotiations on the terms of a Bill of Fundamental Rights, and that pending the \noutcome of such negotiations, execution of death sentences which had not been \ncommuted, would be suspended.  He concluded his statement by saying that: \n\n \n\n \n\nThe government wishes to see a speedy settlement of the future constitutionality of \nthis form of punishment and urges interested parties to join in the discussions on a \nBill of Fundamental Rights.32 \n\n \n[24]  The moratorium was in respect of the carrying out, and not the imposition, of the \n\ndeath sentence.  The death sentence remained a lawful punishment and although the \ncourts may possibly have been influenced by the moratorium, they continued to \nimpose it in cases in which it was considered to be the \"only proper\" sentence.  \nAccording to the statistics provided to us by the Attorney General, 243 persons have \nbeen sentenced to death since the amendment to section 277 in 1990, and of these \nsentences, 143 have been confirmed by the Appellate Division. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     31 South African Government Heads of Argument, Vol 1, authorities, 32-34. \n\n     32 Id. \n\n \n \n\n16 \n\n\f[25] \n\nIn the constitutional negotiations which followed, the issue was not resolved.  Instead, \nthe \"Solomonic solution\" was adopted.33  The death sentence was, in terms, neither \nsanctioned nor excluded, and it was left to the Constitutional Court to decide whether \nthe provisions of the pre-constitutional law making the death penalty a competent \nsentence for murder and other crimes are consistent with Chapter Three of the \nConstitution.  If they are, the death sentence remains a competent sentence for murder \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     33 This is apparent from the reports of the Technical Committee on Fundamental Rights and, in particular, the \nFourth to the Seventh reports, which were brought to our attention by counsel.  The reports show that the \nquestion whether the death penalty should be made an exception to the right to life was \"up for debate\" in the \nNegotiating Council.  The Sixth Report contained the following references to the right to life: \n \n\nLife: (1) Every person shall have the right to life. (2) A law in force at the commencement of subsection \n(1) relating to capital punishment or abortion shall remain in force until repealed or amended by the \n[legislature]. (3) No sentence of death shall be carried out until the [Constitutional Assembly] has \npronounced finally on the abolition or retention of capital punishment. \n\n[Comment:  The Council still has to decide on the inclusion of this right and if so whether its \nformulation should admit of qualification of the type suggested above. The unqualified inclusion of the \nright will result in the [Constitutional Court] having to decide on the validity of any law relating to \ncapital punishment or abortion.]  Sixth Report, 15 July 1993 at 5. \n\n \n \nIn the Seventh Report the right to life was formulated in the terms in which it now appears in section 9 of the \nConstitution.  The report contained the following comment:  \n \n\n[Comment:  The Ad Hoc Committee appointed by the Planning Committee recommends the \nunqualified inclusion of this right in the Chapter. We support this proposal.] Seventh Report, 29 July \n1993 at 3. \n\n \n \n\n17 \n\n\fin cases in which those provisions are applicable, unless and until Parliament \notherwise decides; if they are not, it is our duty to say so, and to declare such \nprovisions to be unconstitutional. \n\n \nSection 11(2) - Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Punishment \n \n\n[26]  Death is the most extreme form of punishment to which a convicted criminal can be \n\nsubjected.  Its execution is final and irrevocable.  It puts an end not only to the right to \nlife itself, but to all other personal rights which had vested in the deceased under \nChapter Three of the Constitution.  It leaves nothing except the memory in others of \nwhat has been and the property that passes to the deceased's heirs.  In the ordinary \nmeaning of the words, the death sentence is undoubtedly a cruel punishment. Once \nsentenced, the prisoner waits on death row in the company of other prisoners under \nsentence of death, for the processes of their appeals and the procedures for clemency \nto be carried out.  Throughout this period, those who remain on death row are \nuncertain of their fate, not knowing whether they will ultimately be reprieved or taken \nto the gallows.  Death is a cruel penalty and the legal processes which necessarily \ninvolve waiting in uncertainty for the sentence to be set aside or carried out, add to \nthe cruelty.  It is also an inhuman punishment for it \"...involves, by its very nature, a \ndenial of the executed person's humanity\",34 and it is degrading because it strips the \nconvicted person of all dignity and treats him or her as an object to be eliminated by \nthe state.  The question is not, however, whether the death sentence is a cruel, \ninhuman or degrading punishment in the ordinary meaning of these words but \nwhether it is a cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment within the meaning of section \n11(2) of our Constitution.35  The accused, who rely on section 11(2) of the \n\n                                                 \n     34 Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 290 (1972)(Brennan, J., concurring). \n\n     35 This has been the approach of certain of the justices of the United States Supreme Court.  Thus, White, J., \nconcurring, who said in Furman v. Georgia, supra note 34, at 312, that \"[T]he imposition and execution of the \ndeath penalty are obviously cruel in the dictionary sense\", was one of the justices who held in Gregg v Georgia, \ninfra note 60, that capital punishment was not per se cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of the \nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.  Burger, CJ., dissenting, refers in Furman's \ncase at 379, 380, and 382 to a punishment being cruel \"in the constitutional sense\".  See also, comments by \nJustice Stewart, concurring in Furman's case at 309, \"... the death sentences now before us are the product of a \n \n \n\n18 \n\n\fConstitution, carry the initial onus of establishing this proposition.36 \n\n \nThe Contentions of the Parties \n \n[27]  The principal arguments advanced by counsel for the accused in support of their \n\ncontention that the imposition of the death penalty for murder is a \"cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading punishment,\" were that the death sentence is an affront to human dignity, is \ninconsistent with the unqualified right to life entrenched in the Constitution, cannot be \ncorrected in case of error or enforced in a manner that is not arbitrary, and that it \nnegates the essential content of the right to life and the other rights that flow from it.  \nThe Attorney General argued that the death penalty is recognised as a legitimate form \nof punishment in many parts of the world, it is a deterrent to violent crime, it meets \nsociety's need for adequate retribution for heinous offences, and it is regarded by \nSouth African society as an acceptable form of punishment.  He asserted that it is, \ntherefore, not cruel, inhuman or degrading within the meaning of section 11(2) of the \nConstitution.  These arguments for and against the death sentence are well known and \nhave been considered in many of the foreign authorities and cases to which we were \nreferred.  We must deal with them now in the light of the provisions of our own \nConstitution.   \n\n \nThe Effect of the Disparity in the Laws Governing Capital Punishment \n                                                                                                                                                        \nlegal system that brings them, I believe, within the very core of the... guarantee against cruel and unusual \npunishments...it is clear that these sentences are 'cruel' in the sense that they excessively go beyond, not in \ndegree but in kind, the punishments that the legislatures have determined to be necessary [citing Weems v. \nUnited States, 217 U.S. 349 (1910)]...death sentences [imposed arbitrarily] are cruel and unusual in the same \nway that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual\". \n\n     36 Matinkinca and Another v Council of State, Ciskei and Another 1994 (1) BCLR 17 (Ck) at 34B-D; \nQozeleni v Minister of Law and Order and Another 1994 (1) BCLR 75(E) at 87D-E.  Cf. Kindler v Canada \n(Minister of Justice) (1992) 6 CRR (2d) 193 at 214. \n\n \n \n\n19 \n\n\f \n[28]  One of the anomalies of the transition initiated by the Constitution is that the Criminal \n\nProcedure Act does not apply throughout South Africa.  This is a consequence of \nsection 229 of the Constitution which provides: \n\n \n\nSubject to this Constitution, all laws which immediately before the commencement \nof this Constitution were in force in any area which forms part of the national \nterritory, shall continue in force in such area, subject to any repeal or amendment \nof such laws by a competent authority. \n\n \n[29]  Prior to the commencement of the Constitution, the Criminal Procedure Act was in \nforce only in the old Republic of South Africa.  Its operation did not extend to the \nformer Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda or Ciskei, which were then treated by South \nAfrican law as independent states and had their own legislation.  Although their \nrespective Criminal Procedure statutes were based on the South African legislation, \nthere were differences, including differences in regard to the death penalty.  The most \nstriking difference in this regard was in Ciskei, where the death sentence was \nabolished on June 8, 1990 by the military regime,37 the de facto government of the \nterritory, and it ceased from that date to be a competent sentence.38  These differences \nstill exist,39 which means that the law governing the imposition of the death sentence \nin South Africa is not uniform. The greatest disparity is in the Eastern Cape Province. \n A person who commits murder and is brought to trial in that part of the province \nwhich was formerly Ciskei, cannot be sentenced to death, whilst a person who \ncommits murder and is brought to trial in another part of the same province, can be \nsentenced to death.  There is no rational reason for this distinction, which is the result \n\n                                                 \n     37 The Criminal Procedure Second Amendment Decree, 1990, Decree No. 16 of 1990 of the Council of State \nof the Republic of Ciskei, 8 June 1990, as amended. \n\n     38 S v Qeqe and Another 1990 (2) SACR 654 (CkAD). \n\n     39 In the former Transkei, Bophuthatswana and Venda the death sentence was a competent verdict for murder \nbut the provisions of the relevant statutes in Transkei and Bophuthatswana are not identical to section 277.  For \nthe purposes of this judgment it is not necessary to analyse the differences, which relate in the main to the \nprocedure prescribed for appeals and the powers of the court on appeal, procedures that are now subject to the \nprovisions of section 241(1) and (1A) of the Constitution, as amended by the Constitution of the Republic of \nSouth Africa Third Amendment Act No. 13 of 1994. \n\n \n \n\n20 \n\n\fof history, and we asked for argument to be addressed to us on the question whether \nthis difference has a bearing on the constitutionality of section 277(1)(a) of the \nCriminal Procedure Act. \n\n \n[30]  Counsel for the accused argued that it did.  They contended that in the circumstances \n\nsection 277 was not a law of general application (which is a requirement under \nsection 33(1) for the validity of any law which limits a Chapter Three right), and that \nthe disparate application of the death sentence within South Africa discriminates \nunfairly between those prosecuted in the former Ciskei and those prosecuted \nelsewhere in South Africa, and offends against the right to \"equality before the law \nand to equal protection of the law.\"40 \n\n \n[31] \n\n \n\nIf the disparity had been the result of legislation enacted after the Constitution had \ncome into force the challenge to the validity of section 277 on these grounds may well \nhave been tenable.  Criminal law and procedure is a national competence and the \nnational government could not without very convincing reasons have established a \n\"safe haven\" in part of one of the provinces in which the death penalty would not be \nenforced.  The disparity is not, however, the result of the legislative policy of the new \nParliament, but a consequence of the Constitution which brings together again in one \ncountry the parts that had been separated under apartheid.  The purpose of section 229 \nwas to ensure an orderly transition, and an inevitable consequence of its provisions is \nthat there will be disparities in the law reflecting pre-existing regional variations, and \nthat this will continue until a uniform system of law has been established by the \nnational and provincial legislatures within their fields of competence as contemplated \nby Chapter Fifteen of the Constitution. \n\n                                                 \n     40 See section 8 of the Constitution. \n\n \n \n\n21 \n\n\f[32]  The requirement of section 229 that existing laws shall continue to be in force subject \nto the Constitution, makes the Constitution applicable to existing laws within each of \nthe geographic areas.  These laws have to meet all the standards prescribed by \nChapter Three, and this no doubt calls for consistency and parity of laws within the \nboundaries of each of the different geographic areas.  It does not, however, mean that \nthere has to be consistency and parity between the laws of the different geographic \nareas themselves.41  Such a construction would defeat the apparent purpose of section \n229, which is to allow different legal orders to exist side by side until a process of \nrationalisation has been carried out, and would inappropriately expose a substantial \npart if not the entire body of our statutory law to challenges under section 8 of the \nConstitution.  It follows that disparities between the legal orders in different parts of \nthe country, consequent upon the provisions of section 229 of the Constitution, cannot \nfor that reason alone be said to constitute a breach of the equal protection provisions \nof section 8, or render the laws such that they are not of general application. \n\n \nInternational and Foreign Comparative Law \n \n\n                                                 \n     41 AK Entertainment CC v Minister of Safety and Security and Others 1995 (1) SACLR 130 (E) at 135-136. \n\n \n \n\n22 \n\n\f[33]  The death sentence is a form of punishment which has been used throughout history \n\nby different societies.  It has long been the subject of controversy.42  As societies \nbecame more enlightened, they restricted the offences for which this penalty could be \nimposed.43  The movement away from the death penalty gained momentum during the \nsecond half of the present century with the growth of the abolitionist movement.  In \nsome countries it is now prohibited in all circumstances, in some it is prohibited save \nin times of war, and in most countries that have retained it as a penalty for crime, its \nuse has been restricted to extreme cases.  According to Amnesty International, 1,831 \nexecutions were carried out throughout the world in 1993 as a result of sentences of \ndeath, of which 1,419 were in China, which means that only 412 executions were \ncarried out in the rest of the world in that year.44  Today, capital punishment has been \nabolished as a penalty for murder either specifically or in practice by almost half the \ncountries of the world including the democracies of Europe and our neighbouring \ncountries, Namibia, Mozambique and Angola.45  In most of those countries where it is \nretained, as the Amnesty International statistics show, it is seldom used. \n\nIn the course of the arguments addressed to us, we were referred to books and articles \non the death sentence, and to judgments dealing with challenges made to capital \npunishment in the courts of other countries and in international tribunals.  The \ninternational and foreign authorities are of value because they analyse arguments for \nand against the death sentence and show how courts of other jurisdictions have dealt \nwith this vexed issue.  For that reason alone they require our attention.  They may also \nhave to be considered because of their relevance to section 35(1) of the Constitution, \n\n \n[34] \n\n                                                 \n     42 An account of the history of the death sentence, the growth of the abolitionist movement, and the \napplication of the death sentence by South African courts is given by Prof. B. van Niekerk in Hanged by the \nNeck Until You Are Dead, (1969) 86 SALJ 457; Professor E. Kahn in The Death Penalty in South Africa, (1970) \n33 THRHR 108; and by Professor G.

In the context of section \n35(1), public international law would include non-binding as well as binding law.46  \nThey may both be used under the section as tools of interpretation.  International \nagreements and customary international law accordingly provide a framework within \nwhich Chapter Three can be evaluated and understood, and for that purpose, decisions \nof tribunals dealing with comparable instruments, such as the United Nations \nCommittee on Human Rights,47 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights,48 \nthe Inter-American Court of Human Rights,49 the European Commission on Human \nRights,50 and the European Court of Human Rights,51 and in appropriate cases, reports \n\n                                                 \n     46 J. Dugard in RIGHTS AND CONSTITUTIONALISM: THE NEW SOUTH AFRICAN LEGAL ORDER 192-195 (Dawid \nvan Wyk et al.eds., Juta & Co., Ltd., 1994).  Professor Dugard suggests, at 193-194, that section 35 requires \nregard to be had to \"all the sources of international law recognised by article 38(1) of the Statute of the \nInternational Court of Justice, ie: \n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n\ninternational conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly \nrecognised by the contesting states; \ninternational custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law; \nthe general principles of law recognized by civilized nations; [and] \n... judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various \nnations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.\" \n\n     47 Established under article 28 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR or \nInternational Covenant) 1966. \n\n     48 Established in terms of article 33 of the American Convention on Human Rights  1969. \n\n     49 Id. \n\n     50 Established in terms of article 19 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and \nFundamental Freedoms, 1950 (\"European Convention\"). \n\n     51 Id. \n \n \n\n24 \n\n\fof specialised agencies such as the International Labour Organisation may provide \nguidance as to the correct interpretation of particular provisions of Chapter Three. \n\n \n[36]  Capital punishment is not prohibited by public international law, and this is a factor \n\nthat has to be taken into account in deciding whether it is cruel, inhuman or degrading \npunishment within the meaning of section 11(2). International human rights \nagreements differ, however, from our Constitution in that where the right to life is \nexpressed in unqualified terms they either deal specifically with the death sentence, or \nauthorise exceptions to be made to the right to life by law.52  This has influenced the \nway international tribunals have dealt with issues relating to capital punishment, and \nis relevant to a proper understanding of such decisions. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     52  The pertinent part of article 6 of the ICCPR reads: \n \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nEvery human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be \nprotected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life. \n...sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes in \naccordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the \ncrime and not contrary to the provisions of the present covenant ... \n\n \nArticle 4(2) of the American Convention on Human Rights and article 2 of the European Convention \nof Human Rights contain similar provisions.  Article 4 of the African Charter of Human an People's \nRights provides: \n \n\nHuman beings are inviolable.  Every human being shall be entitled to respect for his life and \nthe integrity of his person.  No one may be arbitrarily deprived of this right. (Emphasis \nsupplied) \n\n \n \n\n25 \n\n\f[37]  Comparative \"bill of rights\" jurisprudence will no doubt be of importance, \n\nparticularly in the early stages of the transition when there is no developed indigenous \njurisprudence in this branch of the law on which to draw.  Although we are told by \nsection 35(1) that we \"may\" have regard to foreign case law, it is important to \nappreciate that this will not necessarily offer a safe guide to the interpretation of \nChapter Three of our Constitution.53  This has already been pointed out in a number \nof decisions of the Provincial and Local Divisions of the Supreme Court,54 and is \nimplicit in the injunction given to the Courts in section 35(1), which in permissive \nterms allows the Courts to \"have regard to\" such law.  There is no injunction to do \nmore than this. \n\n \n[38]  When challenges to the death sentence in international or foreign courts and tribunals \n\nhave failed, the constitution or the international instrument concerned has either \ndirectly sanctioned capital punishment or has specifically provided that the right to \nlife is subject to exceptions sanctioned by law.  The only case to which we were \nreferred in which there were not such express provisions in the Constitution, was the \ndecision of the Hungarian Constitutional Court.

AB of the (Hungarian) Constitutional Court (George Feher trans.). \n\n \n \n\n26 \n\n\f[39]  Our Constitution expresses the right to life in an unqualified form, and prescribes the \n\ncriteria that have to be met for the limitation of entrenched rights, including the \nprohibition of legislation that negates the essential content of an entrenched right.  In \ndealing with comparative law, we must bear in mind that we are required to construe \nthe South African Constitution, and not an international instrument or the constitution \nof some foreign country, and that this has to be done with due regard to our legal \nsystem, our history and circumstances, and the structure and language of our own \nConstitution.56  We can derive assistance from public international law and foreign \ncase law, but we are in no way bound to follow it.  \n\n \nCapital Punishment in the United States of America \n \n\n                                                 \n     56 The judgment of Kentridge AJ in S v Zuma and Two Others, supra note 6, discusses the relevance of \nforeign case law in the context of the facts of that case, and demonstrates the use that can be made of such \nauthorities in appropriate circumstances. \n\n \n \n\n27 \n\n\f[40]  The earliest litigation on the validity of the death sentence seems to have been \n\npursued in the courts of the United States of America.  It has been said there that the \n\"Constitution itself poses the first obstacle to [the] argument that capital punishment \nis per se unconstitutional\".57  From the beginning, the United States Constitution \nrecognised capital punishment as  lawful.  The Fifth Amendment (adopted in 1791) \nrefers in specific terms to capital punishment and impliedly recognises its validity.  \nThe Fourteenth Amendment (adopted in 1868) obliges the states, not to \"deprive any \nperson of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\" and it too impliedly \nrecognises the right of the states to make laws for such purposes.58  The argument that \ncapital punishment is unconstitutional was based on the Eighth Amendment, which \nprohibits cruel and unusual punishment.59  Although the Eighth Amendment \"has not \nbeen regarded as a static concept\"60 and as drawing its meaning \"from the evolving \nstandards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\",61 the fact that the \nConstitution recognises the lawfulness of capital punishment has proved to be an \nobstacle in the way of the acceptance of this argument, and this is stressed in some of \nthe judgments of the United States Supreme Court.62 \n\n \n[41]  Although challenges under state constitutions to the validity of the death sentence \n\nhave been successful,63 the federal constitutionality of the death sentence as a \nlegitimate form of punishment for murder was affirmed by the United States Supreme \n\n                                                 \n     57 Furman v.

Georgia.64   Both before and after Gregg's case, decisions \nupholding and rejecting challenges to death penalty statutes have divided the Supreme \nCourt, and have led at times to sharply-worded judgments.65  The decisions ultimately \nturned on the votes of those judges who considered the nature of the discretion given \nto the sentencing authority to be the crucial factor. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     64 Supra note 60, at 187. \n\n     65 See, e.g., the concurring opinion of Scalia, J., in Callins v.

North Carolina, supra note 66, at 308 et seq. \n\n \n \n\n29 \n\n\f[42]  Statutes providing for mandatory death sentences, or too little discretion in \n\nsentencing, have been rejected by the Supreme Court because they do not allow for \nconsideration of factors peculiar to the convicted person facing sentence, which may \ndistinguish his or her case from other cases.66  For the same reason, statutes which \nallow too wide a discretion to judges or juries have also been struck down on the \ngrounds that the exercise of such discretion leads to arbitrary results.67  In sum, \ntherefore, if there is no discretion, too little discretion, or an unbounded discretion, the \nprovision authorising the death sentence has been struck down as being contrary to \nthe Eighth Amendment; where the discretion has been \"suitably directed and limited \nso as to minimise the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action\",68 the challenge \nto the statute has failed.69  \n\n \nArbitrariness and Inequality \n \n[43]  Basing his argument on the reasons which found favour with the majority of the \nUnited States Supreme Court in Furman v. Georgia, Mr Trengove contended on \nbehalf of the accused that the imprecise language of section 277, and the unbounded \ndiscretion vested by it in the Courts, make its provisions unconstitutional. \n\n \n[44] \n \n\n \n\nSection 277 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides: \n\nSentence of death \n\n(1) \n\nThe sentence of death may be passed by a superior court only and only  in \n\n                                                 \n     66 Woodson v.

In capital \ncases, where it is likely that the death sentence may be imposed, judges sit with two \nassessors who have an equal vote with the judge on the issue of guilt and on any \nmitigating or aggravating factors relevant to sentence; but sentencing is the \nprerogative of the judge alone.  The Criminal Procedure Act allows a full right of \nappeal to persons sentenced to death, including a right to dispute the sentence without \nhaving to establish an irregularity or misdirection on the part of the trial judge.  The \nAppellate Division is empowered to set the sentence aside if it would not have \nimposed such sentence itself, and it has laid down criteria for the exercise of this \npower by itself and other courts.70  If the person sentenced to death does not appeal, \nthe Appellate Division is nevertheless required to review the case and to set aside the \ndeath sentence if it is of the opinion that it is not a proper sentence.71 \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     70 Criminal Procedure Act No. 51 of 1977, section 322(2A)(as amended by section 13 of Act No. 107 of \n1990). \n\n     71 Id. section 316A(4)(a). \n\n \n \n\n32 \n\n\f[46]  Mitigating and aggravating factors must be identified by the Court, bearing in mind \n\nthat the onus is on the State to prove beyond reasonable doubt the existence of \naggravating factors, and to negative beyond reasonable doubt the presence of any \nmitigating factors relied on by the accused.72  Due regard must be paid to the personal \ncircumstances and subjective factors which might have influenced the accused \nperson's conduct,73 and these factors must then be weighed up with the main objects \nof punishment, which have been held to be:  deterrence, prevention, reformation, and \nretribution.74  In this process \"[e]very relevant consideration should receive the most \nscrupulous care and reasoned attention\",75 and the death sentence should only be \nimposed in the most exceptional cases, where there is no reasonable prospect of \nreformation and the objects of punishment would not be properly achieved by any \nother sentence.76 \n\n \n[47]  There seems to me to be little difference between the guided discretion required for \nthe death sentence in the United States, and the criteria laid down by the Appellate \n\n                                                 \n     72 S v Nkwanyana and Others 1990 (4) SA 735 (A) at 743E-745A. \n\n     73 S v Masina and Others 1990 (4) SA 709 (A) at 718G-H. \n\n     74 S v J 1989 (1) SA 669 (A) at 682G. \"Generally speaking, however, retribution has tended to yield ground \nto the aspects of correction and prevention, and it is deterrence (including prevention) which has been described \nas the 'essential', 'all important', 'paramount' and 'universally admitted' object of punishment\".

The fact that the Appellate \nDivision, a court of experienced judges, takes the final decision in all cases is, in my \nview, more likely to result in consistency of sentencing, than will be the case where \nsentencing is in the hands of jurors who are offered statutory guidance as to how that \ndiscretion should be exercised. \n\n \n[48]  The argument that the imposition of the death sentence under section 277 is arbitrary \nand capricious does not, however, end there.  It also focuses on what is alleged to be \nthe arbitrariness inherent in the application of section 277 in practice. Of the \nthousands of persons put on trial for murder, only a very small percentage are \nsentenced to death by a trial court, and of those, a large number escape the ultimate \npenalty on appeal.77  At every stage of the process there is an element of chance.  The \noutcome may be dependent upon factors such as the way the case is investigated by \nthe police, the way the case is presented by the prosecutor, how effectively the \naccused is defended, the personality and particular attitude to capital punishment of \nthe trial judge and, if the matter goes on appeal, the particular judges who are selected \nto hear the case.  Race78 and poverty are also alleged to be factors. \n\n                                                 \n     77 According to the statistics referred to in the amicus brief of the South African Police approximately 9 000 \nmurder cases are brought to trial each year.  In the more than 40 000 cases that have been heard since the \namendment to section 277 of the Criminal Procedure Act, only 243 persons were sentenced to death, and of \nthese sentences, only 143 were ultimately confirmed on appeal.  See also, Devenish, supra note 42, at 8 and 13. \n\n     78 In the amicus brief of Lawyers for Human Rights, Centre for Applied Legal Studies and the Society for the \nAbolition of the Death Penalty in South Africa it is pointed out that the overwhelming majority of those \n\n \n \n\n34 \n\n\f \n\n                                                                                                                                                        \nsentenced to death are poor and black.  There is an enormous social and cultural divide between those sentenced \nto death and the judges before whom they appear, who are presently almost all white and middle class.  This in \nitself gives rise to problems which even the most meticulous judge  cannot avoid.  The formal trial proceedings \nare recorded in English or Afrikaans, languages which the judges understand and speak, but which many of the \naccused may not understand, or of which they may have only an imperfect understanding.  The evidence of \nwitnesses and the discourse between the judge and the accused often has to be interpreted, and the way this is \ndone influences the proceedings.  The differences in the backgrounds and culture of the judges and the accused \nalso comes into the picture, and is particularly relevant when the personal circumstances of the accused have to \nbe evaluated for the purposes of deciding upon the sentence.  All this is the result of our history, and with the \ndemise of apartheid this will change. Race and class are, however, factors that run deep in our society and \ncannot simply be brushed aside as no longer being relevant. \n\n \n \n\n35 \n\n\f[49]  Most accused facing a possible death sentence are unable to afford legal assistance, \n\nand are defended under the pro deo system. The defending counsel is more often than \nnot young and inexperienced, frequently of a different race to his or her client, and if \nthis is the case, usually has to consult through an interpreter.  Pro deo counsel are \npaid only a nominal fee for the defence, and generally lack the financial resources and \nthe infrastructural support to undertake the necessary investigations and research, to \nemploy expert witnesses to give advice, including advice on matters relevant to \nsentence, to assemble witnesses, to bargain with the prosecution, and generally to \nconduct an effective defence.  Accused persons who have the money to do so, are able \nto retain experienced attorneys and counsel, who are paid to undertake the necessary \ninvestigations and research, and as a result they are less likely to be sentenced to \ndeath than persons similarly placed who are unable to pay for such services.79 \n\n \n[50] \n\nIt needs to be mentioned that there are occasions when senior members of the bar act \npro deo in particularly difficult cases - indeed the present case affords an example of \nthat, for Mr Trengove and his juniors have acted pro deo in the proceedings before us, \nand the Legal Resources Centre who have acted as their instructing attorneys, have \ndone so without charge.  An enormous amount of research has gone into the \npreparation of the argument and it is highly doubtful that even the wealthiest \nmembers of our society could have secured a better service than they have provided.  \nBut this is the exception and not the rule.  This may possibly change as a result of the \nprovisions of section 25(3)(e) of the Constitution, but there are limits to the available \nfinancial and human resources, limits which are likely to exist for the foreseeable \nfuture, and which will continue to place poor accused at a significant disadvantage in \ndefending themselves in capital cases. \n\n                                                 \n     79 I do not want to be understood as being critical of the pro deo counsel who perform an invaluable service, \noften under extremely difficult conditions, and to whom the courts are much indebted.  But the unpalatable truth \nis that most capital cases involve poor people who cannot afford and do not receive as good a defence as those \nwho have means.  In this process, the poor and the ignorant have proven to be the most vulnerable, and are the \npersons most likely to be sentenced to death. \n\n \n \n\n36 \n\n\f \nIt cannot be gainsaid that poverty, race and chance play  roles in the outcome of \ncapital cases and in the final decision as to who should live and who should die.  It is \nsometimes said that this is understood by the judges, and as far as possible, taken into \naccount by them.  But in itself this is no answer to the complaint of arbitrariness; on \nthe contrary, it may introduce an additional factor of arbitrariness that would also \nhave to be taken into account.  Some, but not all accused persons may be acquitted \nbecause such allowances are made, and others who are convicted, but not all, may for \nthe same reason escape the death sentence.80 \n\nIn holding that the imposition and the carrying out of the death penalty in the cases \nthen under consideration constituted cruel and unusual punishment in the United \nStates, Justice Douglas, concurring in Furman v. Georgia, said that \"[a]ny law which \nis nondiscriminatory on its face may be applied in such a way as to violate the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  Discretionary statutes are: \n\n[51] \n\n \n[52] \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     80 See the comments of Curlewis, J in [1991] SAJHR, Vol. 7, p. 229, arguing that judges who do not impose \nthe death sentence when they should do so are not doing their duty.  \"Let me return to the point that troubles the \nauthors: 'that a person's life may depend upon who sits in judgment.'  Of course this happens. I do not know why \nthe authors are so hesitant in saying so.  Their own reasoning, let alone their tables, proves this\".  Id. at 230. \n\n \n \n\n37 \n\n\f...pregnant with discrimination and discrimination is an ingredient not compatible \nwith the idea of equal protection of the laws that is implicit in the ban on \"cruel and \nunusual\" punishments.81 \n\nIt was contended that we should follow this approach and hold that the factors to \nwhich I have referred, make the application of section 277, in practice, arbitrary and \ncapricious and, for that reason, any resulting death sentence is cruel, inhuman and \ndegrading punishment.   \n\n \n[53] \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     81 Furman v. Georgia, supra note 34, at 257. \n\n \n \n\n38 \n\n\f[54]  The differences that exist between rich and poor, between good and bad prosecutions, \n\nbetween good and bad defence, between severe and lenient judges, between judges \nwho favour capital punishment and those who do not, and the subjective attitudes that \nmight be brought into play by factors such as race and class, may in similar ways \naffect any case that comes before the courts, and is almost certainly present to some \ndegree in all court systems.  Such factors can be mitigated, but not totally avoided, by \nallowing convicted persons to appeal to a higher court.  Appeals are decided on the \nrecord of the case and on findings made by the trial court.  If the evidence on record \nand the findings made have been influenced by these factors, there may be nothing \nthat can be done about that on appeal.  Imperfection inherent in criminal trials means \nthat error cannot be excluded; it also means that persons similarly placed may not \nnecessarily receive similar punishment.  This needs to be acknowledged.  What also \nneeds to be acknowledged is that the possibility of error will be present in any system \nof justice and that there cannot be perfect equality as between accused persons in the \nconduct and outcome of criminal trials.  We have to accept these differences in the \nordinary criminal cases that come before the courts, even to the extent that some may \ngo to gaol when others similarly placed may be acquitted or receive non-custodial \nsentences.  But death is different, and the question is, whether this is acceptable when \nthe difference is between life and death.  Unjust imprisonment is a great wrong, but if \nit is discovered, the prisoner can be released and compensated; but the killing of an \ninnocent person is irremediable.82 \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     82 \"While this court has the power to correct constitutional or other errors retroactively...it cannot, of course, \nraise the dead.\"  Suffolk District v. Watson and Others, 381 Mass. 648, 663 (1980)(Hennessy, CJ.)(plurality \ndecision holding the death penalty unconstitutionally cruel under the Massachusetts State Constitution).  \"Death, \nin its finality, differs more from life imprisonment than a 100-year prison term differs from one of only a year or \ntwo.  Because of the qualitative difference, there is a corresponding difference in the need for reliability in the \ndetermination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case\".  Woodson v. North Carolina, supra \nnote 66, at 305 (Stewart, Powell and Stevens, JJ.).  \n\n \n \n\n39 \n\n\f[55] \n\nIn the United States, the Supreme Court has addressed itself primarily to the \nrequirement of due process. Statutes have to be clear and discretion curtailed without \nignoring the peculiar circumstances of each accused person.  Verdicts are set aside if \nthe defence has not been adequate,83 and persons sentenced to death are allowed wide \nrights of appeal and review.  This attempt to ensure the utmost procedural fairness has \nitself led to problems.  The most  notorious is the \"death row phenomenon\" in which \nprisoners cling to life, exhausting every possible avenue of redress, and using every \ndevice to put off the date of execution, in the natural and understandable hope that \nthere will be a reprieve from the Courts or the executive.  It is common for prisoners \nin the United States to remain on death row for many years, and this dragging out of \nthe process has been characterised as being cruel and degrading.84  The difficulty of \n\n                                                 \n     83 Voyles v. Watkins, 489 F.Supp 901 (D.D.C.: N.D.Miss. 1980).  See also, People v. Frierson, 599 P.2d. 587 \n(1979).  Cf. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932). \n\n     84 Furman v. Georgia, supra note 34, at 288-289 (Brennan, J., concurring).  Although in the United States \nprolonged delay extending even to more than ten years has not been held, in itself, a reason for setting aside a \ndeath sentence, Richmond v. Lewis, 948 F.2d 1473, 1491 (9th Cir. 1990)(rejecting a claim that execution after \nsixteen years on death row would constitute curel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendments), in other jurisdictions a different view is taken. \n \n\nIt is part of the human condition that a condemned man will take every opportunity to save his life \nthrough use of the appellate procedure.  If the appellate procedure enables the prisoner to prolong the \nappellate hearings over a period of years, the fault is to attributed to the appellate system that permits \nsuch delay and not to the prisoner who takes advantage of it.  Appellate procedures that echo down the \nyears are not compatible with capital punishment.  The death row phenomenon must not become \nestablished as a part of our jurisprudence. \n\n \nPratt v Attorney-General for Jamaica, supra note 3, at 1014. \n\n \n \n\n40 \n\n\fimplementing a system of capital punishment which on the one hand avoids \narbitrariness by insisting on a high standard of procedural fairness, and on the other \nhand avoids delays that in themselves are the cause of impermissible cruelty and \ninhumanity, is apparent.  Justice Blackmun, who sided with the majority in Gregg's \ncase, ultimately came to the conclusion that it is not possible to design a system that \navoids arbitrariness.85  To design a system that avoids arbitrariness and delays in \ncarrying out the sentence is even more difficult. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     85 Callins v. Collins, supra note 62, (Blackmun, J., dissenting). \n\n \n \n\n41 \n\n\f[56]  The United States jurisprudence has not resolved the dilemma arising from the fact \nthat the Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishments, but also permits, and \ncontemplates that there will be capital punishment.  The acceptance by a majority of \nthe United States Supreme Court of the proposition that capital punishment is not per \nse unconstitutional, but that in certain circumstances it may be arbitrary, and thus \nunconstitutional, has led to endless litigation.  Considerable expense and interminable \ndelays result from the exceptionally-high standard of procedural fairness set by the \nUnited States courts in attempting to avoid arbitrary decisions.  The difficulties that \nhave been experienced in following this path, to which Justice Blackmun and Justice \nScalia have both referred,86 but from which they have drawn different conclusions, \npersuade me that we should not follow this route. \n\n \nThe Right to Dignity \n \n[57]  Although the United States Constitution does not contain a specific guarantee of \nhuman dignity, it has been accepted by the United States Supreme Court that the \nconcept of human dignity is at the core of the prohibition of \"cruel and unusual \npunishment\" by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.87  For Brennan J this was \ndecisive of the question in Gregg v. Georgia. \n\n \n\nThe fatal constitutional infirmity in the punishment of death is that it treats \n\n                                                 \n     86 Id. (compare Scalia, J., concurring, with Blackmun, J., dissenting). \n\n     87 Trop v. Dulles, supra note 61, at 100.  See also, Furman v. Georgia, supra note 34, at 270-281 (Brennan, \nJ., concurring); Gregg v Georgia, supra note 60, at 173; People v. Anderson, supra note 62, at 895 (\"The dignity \nof man, the individual and the society as a whole, is today demeaned by our continued practice of capital \npunishment.\"). \n\n \n \n\n42 \n\n\f\"members of the human race as nonhumans, as objects to be toyed with and \ndiscarded. [It is] thus inconsistent with the fundamental premise of the Clause that \neven the vilest criminal remains a human being possessed of common human \ndignity.\"88 \n\n \n[58]  Under our constitutional order the right to human dignity is specifically guaranteed.  \n\nIt can only be limited by legislation which passes the stringent test of being \n'necessary'. The weight given to human dignity by Justice Brennan is wholly \nconsistent with the values of our Constitution and the new order established by it.  It \nis also consistent with the approach to extreme punishments followed by courts in \nother countries. \n\n \n[59] \n\nIn Germany, the Federal Constitutional Court has stressed this aspect of punishment. \n \n\n                                                 \n     88 Gregg v. Georgia, supra note 60, at 230 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (quoting his opinion in Furman v. \nGeorgia, at 273).  See also, Furman v. Georgia, supra note 34, at 296, where Brennan, J., concurring, states:  \n\"The country has debated whether a society for which the dignity of the individual is the supreme value can, \nwithout a fundamental inconsistency, follow the practice of deliberately putting some of its members to death.\" \n\n \n \n\n43 \n\n\fRespect for human dignity especially requires the prohibition of cruel, inhuman, \nand degrading punishments.  [The state] cannot turn the offender into an object of \ncrime prevention to the detriment of his constitutionally protected right to social \nworth and respect.89 \n\n \n[60]  That capital punishment constitutes a serious impairment of human dignity has also \nbeen recognised by judgments of the Canadian Supreme Court.  Kindler v Canada90 \nwas concerned with the extradition from Canada to the United States of two fugitives, \nKindler, who had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death in the United \nStates, and Ng who was facing a murder charge there and a possible death sentence.  \nThree of the seven judges who heard the cases expressed the opinion that the death \npenalty was cruel and unusual: \n\n \n\nIt is the supreme indignity to the individual, the ultimate corporal punishment, the \nfinal and complete lobotomy and the absolute and irrevocable castration.  [It is] the \nultimate desecration of human dignity...91 \n\n \n[61]  Three other judges were of the opinion that: \n \n\n                                                 \n     89 [1977] 45 BVerfGE 187, 228 (Life Imprisonment case)(as translated in Kommers, supra note 18, at 316).  \nThe statement was made in the context of a discussion on punishment to be meted out in respect of murders of \nwanton cruelty.  It was held that a life sentence was a competent sentence as long as it allowed the possibility of \nparole for a reformed prisoner rehabilitated during his or her time in prison.  \n\n     90 (1992) 6 CRR (2d) 193 SC. \n\n     91 Id. at 241 (per Cory, J, dissenting with Lamer, CJC, concurring).  See also, Sopinka, J, dissenting (with \nLamer, CJC, concurring) at 220. \n\n \n \n\n44 \n\n\f[t]here is strong ground for believing, having regard to the limited extent to which \nthe death penalty advances any valid penological objectives and the serious \ninvasion of human dignity it engenders, that the death penalty cannot, except in \nexceptional circumstances, be justified in this country.92 \n\n \n\nIn the result, however, the majority of the Court held that the validity of the order for \nextradition did not depend upon the constitutionality of the death penalty in Canada, \nor the guarantee in its Charter of Rights against cruel and unusual punishment.  The \nCharter was concerned with legislative and executive acts carried out in Canada, and \nan order for extradition neither imposed nor authorised any punishment within the \nborders of Canada. \n\n \n[62]  The issue in Kindler's case was whether the action of the Minister of Justice, who had \nauthorised the extradition without any assurance that the death penalty would not be \nimposed, was constitutional.  It was argued that this executive act was contrary to \nsection 12 of the Charter which requires the executive to act in accordance with \nfundamental principles of justice. The Court decided by a majority of four to three \nthat in the particular circumstances of the case the decision of the Minister of Justice \ncould not be set aside on these grounds.  In balancing the international obligations of \nCanada in respect of extradition, and another purpose of the extradition legislation - \nto prevent Canada from becoming a safe haven for criminals, against the likelihood \nthat the fugitives would be executed if returned to the United States, the view of the \nmajority was that the decision to return the fugitives to the United States could not be \nsaid to be contrary to the fundamental principles of justice.  In their view, it would not \nshock the conscience of Canadians to permit this to be done.   \n\n \nThe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \n \n[63]  Ng and Kindler took their cases to the Human Rights Committee of the United \n\nNations, contending that Canada had breached its obligations under the International \n\n                                                 \n     92 Id. at 202 (per La Forest, J)(L'Heureux-Dube and Gonthier, JJ concurring). \n\n \n \n\n45 \n\n\fCovenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Once again, there was a division of opinion \nwithin the tribunal.  In Ng's case it was said: \n\nThe Committee is aware that, by definition, every execution of a sentence of death \nmay be considered to constitute cruel and inhuman treatment within the meaning \nof article 7 of the covenant.93 \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     93 Ng v Canada, supra note 23, at 21. \n\n \n \n\n46 \n\n\f[64]  There was no dissent from that statement.  But the International Covenant contains \n\nprovisions permitting, with some qualifications, the imposition of capital punishment \nfor the most serious crimes.  In view of these provisions, the majority  of the \nCommittee were of the opinion that the extradition of fugitives to a country which \nenforces the death sentence in accordance with the requirements of the International \nCovenant, should not be regarded as a breach of the obligations of the extraditing \ncountry.  In Ng's case, the method of execution which he faced if extradited was \nasphyxiation in a gas chamber.  This was found by a majority of the Committee to \ninvolve unnecessary physical and mental suffering and, notwithstanding the sanction \ngiven to capital punishment, to be cruel punishment within the meaning of article 7 of \nthe International Covenant.  In Kindler's case, in which the complaint was delivered at \nthe same time as that in the Ng's case, but the decision was given earlier, it was held \nthat the method of execution which was by lethal injection was not a cruel method of \nexecution, and that the extradition did not in the circumstances constitute a breach of \nCanada's obligations under the International Covenant.94 \n\n \n[65]  The Committee also held in Kindler's case that prolonged judicial proceedings giving \n\nrise to the death row phenomenon does not per se constitute cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading treatment.  There were dissents in both cases.  Some Commissioners in \nNg's case held that asphyxiation was not crueller than other forms of execution.  Some \nin Kindler's case held that the provision of the International Covenant against the \narbitrary deprivation of the right to life took priority over the provisions of the \nInternational Covenant which allow the death sentence, and that Canada ought not in \nthe circumstances to have extradited Kindler without an assurance that he would not \nbe executed. \n\n \n[66] \n\nIt should be mentioned here that although articles 6(2) to (5) of the International \nCovenant specifically allow the imposition of the death sentence under strict controls \n\n                                                 \n     94 Joseph Kindler v Canada, United Nations Committee on Human Rights, Communication No 470/1991, 30 \nJuly 1993. \n\n \n \n\n47 \n\n\f\"for the most serious crimes\" by those countries which have not abolished it, it \nprovides in article 6(6) that \"[n]othing in this article shall be invoked to delay or to \nprevent the abolition of capital punishment by any State Party to the present \nCovenant.\"  The fact that the International Covenant sanctions capital punishment \nmust be seen in this context.  It tolerates but does not provide justification for the \ndeath penalty. \n\n \n[67]  Despite these differences of opinion, what is clear from the decisions of the Human \nRights Committee of the United Nations is that the death penalty is regarded by it as \ncruel and inhuman punishment within the ordinary meaning of those words, and that \nit was because of the specific provisions of the International Covenant authorising the \nimposition of capital punishment by member States in certain circumstances, that the \nwords had to be given a narrow meaning.   \n\n \nThe European Convention on Human Rights \n \n[68]  Similar issues were debated by the European Court of Human Rights in Soering v \n\nUnited Kingdom.95  This case was also concerned with the extradition to the United \nStates of a fugitive to face murder charges for which capital punishment was a \ncompetent sentence.  It was argued that this would expose him to inhuman and \ndegrading treatment or punishment in breach of article 3 of the European Convention \non Human Rights.  Article 2 of the European Convention protects the right to life but \nmakes an exception in the case of \"the execution of a sentence of a court following \n[the] conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.\"  The majority \nof the Court held that article 3 could not be construed as prohibiting all capital \npunishment, since to do so would nullify article 2.  It was, however, competent to test \nthe imposition of capital punishment in particular cases against the requirements of \narticle 3 -- the manner in which it is imposed or executed, the personal circumstances \nof the condemned person and the disproportionality to the gravity of the crime \ncommitted, as well as the conditions of detention awaiting execution, were capable of \n\n                                                 \n     95 (1989) 11 EHRR 439 at paras. 103, 105 and 111. \n\n \n \n\n48 \n\n\fbringing the treatment or punishment received by the condemned person within the \nproscription. \n\n \n[69]  On the facts, it was held that extradition to the United States to face trial in Virginia \nwould expose the fugitive to the risk of treatment going beyond the threshold set by \narticle 3.  The special factors taken into account were the youth of the fugitive (he \nwas 18 at the time of the murders), an impaired mental capacity, and the suffering on \ndeath row which could endure for up to eight years if he were convicted.  \nAdditionally, although the offence for which extradition was sought had been \ncommitted in the United States, the fugitive who was a German national was also \nliable to be tried for the same offence in Germany.  Germany, which has abolished the \ndeath sentence, also sought his extradition for the murders. There was accordingly a \nchoice in regard to the country to which the fugitive should be extradited, and that \nchoice should have been exercised in a way which would not lead to a contravention \nof article 3.  What weighed with the Court was the fact that the choice facing the \nUnited Kingdom was not a choice between extradition to face a possible death \npenalty and no punishment, but a choice between extradition to a country which \nallows the death penalty and one which does not.  We are in a comparable position.  A \nholding by us that the death penalty for murder is unconstitutional, does not involve a \nchoice between freedom and death; it involves a choice between death in the very few \ncases which would otherwise attract that penalty under section 277(1)(a), and the \nsevere penalty of life imprisonment. \n\n  \nCapital Punishment in India \n \n[70] \n\nIn the amicus brief of the South African Police, reliance was placed on decisions of \nthe Indian Supreme Court, and it is necessary to refer briefly to the way the law has \ndeveloped in that country. \n\n \n[71] \n\n \n \n\nSection 302 of the Indian Penal Code authorises the imposition of the death sentence \n\n49 \n\n\fas a penalty for murder. In Bachan Singh v State of Punjab,96 the constitutionality of \nthis provision was put in issue.  Article 21 of the Indian Constitution provides that: \n\n \n\nNo person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty  except according to \nprocedure established by law. \n\n \n[72]  The wording of this article presented an obstacle to a challenge to the death sentence, \nbecause there was a \"law\" which made provision for the death sentence.  Moreover, \narticle 72 of the Constitution empowers the President and Governors to commute \nsentences of death, and article 134  refers to the Supreme Court's powers on appeal in \ncases where the death sentence has been imposed.  It was clear, therefore, that capital \npunishment was specifically contemplated and sanctioned by the framers of the Indian \nConstitution, when it was adopted by them in November 1949.97 \n\n \n[73]  Counsel for the accused in Bachan Singh's case sought to overcome this difficulty by \n\ncontending that article 21 had to be read with article 19(1), which guarantees the \nfreedoms of speech, of assembly, of association, of movement, of residence, and the \nfreedom to engage in any occupation.  These fundamental freedoms can only be \nrestricted under the Indian Constitution if the restrictions are reasonable for the \nattainment of a number of purposes defined in sections 19(2) to (6).  It was contended \nthat the right to life was basic to the enjoyment of these fundamental freedoms, and \nthat the death sentence restricted them unreasonably in that it served no social \npurpose, its deterrent effect was unproven and it defiled the dignity of the individual. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     96 (1980) 2 SCC 684. \n\n     97 Id. at 730, para. 136. \n\n \n \n\n50 \n\n\f[74]  The Supreme Court analysed the provisions of article 19(1) and came to the \n\nconclusion, for reasons that are not material to the present case, that the provisions of \nsection 302 of the Indian Penal Code did \"not have to stand the test of article 19(1) of \nthe Constitution.\"98  It went on, however, to consider \"arguendo\" what the outcome \nwould be if the test of reasonableness and public interest under article 19(1) had to be \nsatisfied.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     98 Id. at 709, para. 61. \n\n \n \n\n51 \n\n\f[75]  The Supreme Court had recognised in a number of cases that the death sentence \nserved as a deterrent, and the Law Commission of India, which had conducted an \ninvestigation into capital punishment in 1967, had recommended that capital \npunishment be retained.  The court held that in the circumstances it was \"for the \npetitioners to prove and establish that the death sentence for murder is so outmoded, \nunusual or excessive as to be devoid of any rational nexus with the purpose and object \nof the legislation.\"99 \n\n \n[76]  The Court then dealt with international authorities for and against the death sentence, \nand with the arguments concerning deterrence and retribution.100  After reviewing the \narguments for and against the death sentence, the court concluded that: \n\n \n\n...the question whether or not [the] death penalty serves any penological purpose is \na difficult, complex and intractable issue [which] has evoked strong, divergent \nviews.  For the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the impugned provisions \nas to death penalty ... on the grounds of reasonableness in the light of Articles 19 \nand 21 of the Constitution, it is not necessary for us to express any categorical \nopinion, one way or another, as to which of these antithetical views, held by the \nAbolitionists and the Retentionists, is correct.  It is sufficient to say that the very \nfact that persons of reason, learning and light are rationally and deeply divided in \ntheir opinion on this issue, is ground among others, for rejecting the petitioners' \n\n                                                 \n     99 Id. at 712, para. 71. \n\n     100 I have not yet dealt specifically with the issues of deterrence, prevention and retribution, on which the \nAttorney General placed reliance in his argument.  These are all factors relevant to the purpose of punishment \nand are present both in capital punishment, and in the alternative of imprisonment.  Whether they serve to make \ncapital punishment a more effective punishment than imprisonment is relevant to the argument on justification, \nand will be considered when that argument is dealt with. For the moment it is sufficient to say that they do not \nhave a bearing on the nature of the punishment, and need not be taken into account at this stage of the enquiry. \n\n \n \n\n52 \n\n\fargument that retention of death penalty in the impugned provision, is totally \ndevoid of reason and purpose.101 \n\n \n\nIt accordingly held that section 302 of the Indian Penal Code \"violates neither the \nletter nor the ethos of Article 19.\"102 \n\n[77]  The Court then went on to deal with article 21. It said that if article 21 were to be \nexpanded in accordance with the interpretative principle applicable to legislation \nlimiting rights under Article 19(1), article 21 would have to be read as follows: \n\n \n\n \n\nNo person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to fair, \njust and reasonable procedure established by a valid law. \n\n                                                 \n     101 Supra note 96, at 729, para. 132. \n\n     102 Id. \n\n \n \n\n53 \n\n\fAnd thus expanded, it was clear that the State could deprive a person of his or her life, \nby \"fair, just and reasonable procedure.\"  In the circumstances, and taking into \naccount the  indications that capital punishment was considered by the framers of the \nconstitution in 1949 to be a valid penalty, it was asserted that \"by no stretch of the \nimagination can it be said that death penalty...either per se or because of its execution \nby hanging constitutes an unreasonable, cruel or unusual punishment\" prohibited by \nthe Constitution.103  \n\n \n[78]  The wording of the relevant provisions of our Constitution are different.  The question \nwe have to consider is not whether the imposition of the death sentence for murder is \n\"totally devoid of reason and purpose\", or whether the death sentence for murder \"is \ndevoid of any rational nexus\" with the purpose and object of section 277(1)(a) of the \nCriminal Procedure Act.  It is whether in the context of our Constitution, the death \npenalty is cruel, inhuman or degrading, and if it is, whether it can be justified in terms \nof section 33.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     103 Supra note 96, at 730-731, para. 136.  For similar reasons, the death penalty was held not to be \ninconsistent with the Constitution of Botswana, or with the Constitution of the former Bophuthatswana.  S v \nNtesang 1995 (4) BCLR 426 (Botswana); S v Chabalala 1986 (3) SA 623 (B AD). \n\n \n \n\n54 \n\n\f[79]  The Indian Penal Code leaves the imposition of the death sentence to the trial judge's \ndiscretion.  In Bachan Singh's case there was also a challenge to the constitutionality \nof the legislation on the grounds of arbitrariness, along the lines of the challenges that \nhave been successful in the United States.  The majority of the Court rejected the \nargument that the imposition of the death sentence in such circumstances is arbitrary, \nholding that a discretion exercised judicially by persons of experience and standing, \nin accordance with principles crystallized by judicial decisions, is not an arbitrary \ndiscretion.104  To complete the picture, it should be mentioned that long delays in \ncarrying out the death sentence in particular cases have apparently been held in India \nto be unjust and unfair to the prisoner, and in such circumstances the death sentence is \nliable to be set aside.105 \n\n \n \nThe Right to Life \n \n[80]  The unqualified right to life vested in every person by section 9 of our Constitution is \n\nanother factor crucially relevant to the question whether the death sentence is cruel, \ninhuman or degrading punishment within the meaning of section 11(2) of our \nConstitution.  In this respect our Constitution differs materially from the Constitutions \nof the United States and India.  It also differs materially from the European \nConvention and the International Covenant.  Yet in the cases decided under these \nconstitutions and treaties there were judges who dissented and held that \nnotwithstanding the specific language of the constitution or instrument concerned, \ncapital punishment should not be permitted.  \n\n                                                 \n     104 Id. at 740, para. 165.  Bhagwati J dissented.  The dissenting judgement is not available to me, but \naccording to AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, WHEN THE STATE KILLS, supra note 42, at 147, Bhagwati J asserted in \nhis judgement that \"[t]he prevailing standards of human decency are incompatible with [the] death penalty.\" \n\n     105 Triveniben v State of Gujarat [1992] LRC(Const.) 425 (Sup. Ct. of India); Daya Singh v Union of India \n[1992] LRC(Const.) 452 (Sup. Ct. of India). \n\n \n \n\n55 \n\n\f \n[81] \n\n \n[82] \n\n \n\nIn some instances the dissent focused on the right to life.  In Soering's case before the \nEuropean Court of Human Rights, Judge de Meyer, in a concurring opinion, said that \ncapital punishment is \"not consistent with the present state of European \ncivilisation\"106 and for that reason alone, extradition to the United States would \nviolate the fugitive's right to life. \n\nIn a dissent in the United Nations Human Rights Committee in Kindler's case, \nCommittee member B. Wennergren also stressed the importance of the right to life. \n\n                                                 \n     106 Supra note 95, at 484. \n\n \n \n\n56 \n\n\fThe value of life is immeasurable for any human being, and the right to life \nenshrined in article 6 of the Covenant is the supreme human right.  It is an \nobligation of States [P]arties to the Covenant to protect the lives of all human \nbeings on their territory and under their jurisdiction.  If issues arise in respect of \nthe protection of the right to life, priority must not be accorded to the domestic \nlaws of other countries or to (bilateral) treaty articles.  Discretion of any nature \npermitted under an extradition treaty cannot apply, as there is no room for it under \nCovenant obligations.  It is worth repeating that no derogation from a State's \nobligations under article 6, paragraph 1, is permitted.  This is why Canada, in my \nview, violated article 6, paragraph 1, by consenting to extradite Mr. Kindler to the \nUnited States, without having secured assurances that Mr. Kindler would not be \nsubjected to the execution of the death sentence.107 \n\n \n[83]  An individual's right to life has been described as \"[t]he most fundamental of all \n\nhuman rights\",108 and was dealt with in that way in the judgments of the Hungarian \nConstitutional Court declaring capital punishment to be unconstitutional.109  The \nchallenge to the death sentence in Hungary was based on section 54 of its \nConstitution which provides: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n[84] \n\n(1) In the Republic of Hungary everyone has the inherent  right to life and to \nhuman dignity, and no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of these rights. \n\n(2) No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel or inhuman or degrading \npunishment \n\nSection 8, the counterpart of section 33 of our Constitution, provides that laws shall \nnot impose any limitations on the essential content of fundamental rights.  According \nto the finding of the Court, capital punishment imposed a limitation on the essential \n\n                                                 \n     107 Joseph Kindler v Canada, supra note 94, at 23. \n\n     108 Per Lord Bridge in R v Home Secretary, Ex parte Bugdaycay (1987) AC 514 at 531G. \n\n     109 Supra note 55. \n\n \n \n\n57 \n\n\fcontent of the fundamental rights to life and human dignity, eliminating them \nirretrievably.  As such it was unconstitutional.  Two factors are stressed in the \njudgment of the Court.  First, the relationship between the rights of life and dignity, \nand the importance of these rights taken together.  Secondly, the absolute nature of \nthese two rights taken together.  Together they are the source of all other rights.  \nOther rights may be limited, and may even be withdrawn and then granted again, but \ntheir ultimate limit is to be found in the preservation of the twin rights of life and \ndignity.  These twin rights are the essential content of all rights under the \nConstitution.  Take them away, and all other rights cease.  I will deal later with the \nrequirement of our Constitution that a right shall not be limited in ways which negate \nits essential content.   For the present purposes it is sufficient to point to the fact that \nthe Hungarian Court held capital punishment to be unconstitutional on the grounds \nthat it is inconsistent with the right to life and the right to dignity. \n\n \n[85]  Our Constitution does not contain the qualification found in section 54(1) of the \n\nHungarian constitution, which prohibits only the arbitrary deprivation of life.  To that \nextent, therefore, the right to life in section 9 of our Constitution is given greater \nprotection than it is by the Hungarian Constitution.   \n\n  \n[86]  The fact that in both the United States and India, which sanction capital punishment, \n\nthe highest courts have intervened on constitutional grounds in particular cases to \nprevent the carrying out of death sentences, because in the particular circumstances of \nsuch cases, it would have been cruel to do so, evidences the importance attached to \nthe protection of life and the strict scrutiny to which the imposition and carrying out \nof death sentences are subjected when a constitutional challenge is raised.  The same \nconcern is apparent in the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and the \nUnited Nations Committee on Human Rights.  It led the Court in Soering's case to \norder that extradition to the United States, in the circumstances of that case, would \nresult in inhuman or degrading punishment, and the Human Rights Committee to \ndeclare in Ng's case that he should not be extradited to face a possible death by \nasphyxiation in a gas chamber in California. \n\n \n \n \n\n58 \n\n\fPublic Opinion \n \n[87]  The Attorney General argued that what is cruel, inhuman or degrading depends to a \n\nlarge extent upon contemporary attitudes within society, and that South African \nsociety does not regard the death sentence for extreme cases of murder as a cruel, \ninhuman or degrading form of punishment. It was disputed whether public opinion, \nproperly informed of the different considerations, would in fact favour the death \npenalty.  I am, however, prepared to assume that it does and that the majority of South \nAfricans agree that the death sentence should be imposed in extreme cases of murder. \n The question before us, however, is not what the majority of South Africans believe a \nproper sentence for murder should be.  It is whether the Constitution allows the \nsentence. \n\n \n[88]  Public opinion may have some relevance to the enquiry, but in itself, it is no \n\nsubstitute for the duty vested in the Courts to interpret the Constitution and to uphold \nits provisions without fear or favour.  If public opinion were to be decisive there \nwould be no need for constitutional adjudication.  The protection of rights could then \nbe left to Parliament, which has a mandate from the public, and is answerable to the \npublic for the way its mandate is exercised, but this would be a return to \nparliamentary sovereignty, and a retreat from the new legal order established by the \n1993 Constitution.  By the same token the issue of the constitutionality of capital \npunishment cannot be referred to a referendum, in which a majority view would \nprevail over the wishes of any minority.  The very reason for establishing the new \nlegal order, and for vesting the power of judicial review of all legislation in the courts, \nwas to protect the rights of minorities and others who cannot protect their rights \nadequately through the democratic process.  Those who are entitled to claim this \nprotection include the social outcasts and marginalised  people of our society.  It is \nonly if there is a willingness to protect the worst and the weakest amongst us, that all \nof us can be secure that our own rights will be protected.  \n\n \n[89]  This Court cannot allow itself to be diverted from its duty to act as an independent \narbiter of the Constitution by making choices on the basis that they will find favour \n\n \n \n\n59 \n\n\fwith the public.110  Justice Powell's comment in his dissent in  Furman v Georgia \nbears repetition: \n\n...the weight of the evidence indicates that the public generally has not accepted \neither the morality or the social merit of the views so passionately advocated by the \narticulate spokesmen for abolition.  But however one may assess amorphous ebb \nand flow of public opinion generally on this volatile issue, this type of inquiry lies \nat the periphery - not the core - of the judicial process in constitutional cases.  The \nassessment of popular opinion is essentially a legislative, and not a judicial, \nfunction.111 \n\nSo too does the comment of Justice Jackson in West Virginia State Board of \nEducation v Barnette:  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     110 \"The cruel or unusual punishment clause of the California Constitution, like other provisions of the \nDeclaration of Rights, operates to restrain legislative and executive action and to protect fundamental individual \nand minority rights against encroachment by the majority.  It is the function of the court to examine legislative \nacts in the light of such constitutional mandates to ensure that the promise of the Declaration of Rights is a \nreality to the individual (citations omitted)...Were it otherwise, the Legislature would ever be the sole judge of \nthe permissible means and extent of punishment and article I, section 6, of the Constitution would be \nsuperfluous.\"  People v. Anderson, supra note 62, at 888.  This  was also the approach of the President of the \nHungarian Constitutional Court in his concurring opinion on the constitutionality of capital punishment, where \nhe said: \"The Constitutional Court is not bound either by the will of the majority or by public sentiments.\"  \nSupra note 55, at 12.  See also, Gregg v. Georgia, supra note 60, at 880.  In the decisive judgment of the Court, \nJustices Stewart, Powell and Stevens, accepted that \"...the Eighth Amendment demands more than that a \nchallenged punishment be acceptable to contemporary society.  The Court also must ask whether it comports \nwith the basic concept of human dignity at the core of the Amendment.\" (citation omitted) \n\n     111 Supra note 34, at 443. \n\n \n \n\n60 \n\n\fThe very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the \nvicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities \nand officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.  \nOne's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of \nworship and assembly and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; \nthey depend on the outcome of no elections.112 \n\n \nCruel, Inhuman and Degrading Punishment \n \n[90]  The United Nations Committee on Human Rights has held that the death sentence by \n\ndefinition is cruel and degrading punishment.  So has the Hungarian Constitutional \nCourt, and three judges of the Canadian Supreme Court.  The death sentence has also \nbeen held to be cruel or unusual punishment and thus unconstitutional under the state \nconstitutions of Massachusetts and California.113 \n \n\n  \n\n                                                 \n     112 319 U.S. 624, 638 (1943). \n\n     113 The Californian Constitution was subsequently amended to sanction capital punishment. \n\n \n \n\n61 \n\n\f[91]  The California decision is People v. Anderson.114  Capital punishment was held by six \n\nof the seven judges of the Californian Supreme Court to be \"impermissibly cruel\"115 \nunder the California Constitution which prohibited cruel or unusual punishment.  \nAlso, \n\n \n\n  \n[92] \n\nIt degrades and dehumanizes all who participate in its processes.  It is unnecessary \nto any legitimate goal of the state and is incompatible with the dignity of man and \nthe judicial process.116 \n\nIn the Massachusetts decision in District Attorney for the Suffolk District v.  \nWatson,117 where the Constitution of the State of Massachusetts prohibited cruel or \nunusual punishment, the death sentence was also held, by six of the seven judges, to \nbe impermissibly cruel.118 \n\n                                                 \n     114 Supra note 62. \n\n     115 Id. at 899.

Under our \nConstitution it will not meet the requirements of section 11(2) if it is cruel, or \ninhuman, or degrading. \n\n                                                                                                                                                        \ndiscrimination...inevitably persist even under a statute which meets the demands of Furman.\" Id. at 670.  \n\"...[T]he supreme punishment of death, inflicted as it is by chance and caprice, may not stand.\" Id. at 671. \"The \ndeath sentence itself is a declaration that society deems the prisoner a nullity, less than human and unworthy to \nlive.  But that negation of his personality carries through the entire period between sentence and execution.\" Id. \nat 683 (Liacos, J., concurring). \n\n \n \n\n63 \n\n\f[94]  Proportionality is an ingredient to be taken into account in deciding whether a penalty \nis cruel, inhuman or degrading.119  No Court would today uphold the constitutionality \nof a statute that makes the death sentence a competent sentence for the cutting down \nof trees or the killing of deer, which were capital offences in England in the 18th \nCentury.120  But murder is not to be equated with such \"offences.\"  The wilful taking \nof an innocent life calls for a severe penalty, and there are many countries which still \nretain the death penalty as a sentencing option for such cases.  Disparity between the \ncrime and the penalty is not the only ingredient of proportionality; factors such as the \nenormity and irredeemable character of the death sentence in circumstances where \nneither error nor arbitrariness can be excluded, the expense and difficulty of \naddressing the disparities which exist in practice between accused persons facing \nsimilar charges, and which are due to factors such as race, poverty, and ignorance, \nand the other subjective factors which have been mentioned, are also factors that can \nand should be taken into account in dealing with this issue.  It may possibly be that \nnone alone would be sufficient under our Constitution to justify a finding that the \ndeath sentence is cruel, inhuman or degrading. But these factors are not to be \nevaluated in isolation. They must be taken together, and in order to decide whether \nthe threshold set by section 11(2) has been crossed121 they must be evaluated with \nother relevant factors, including the two fundamental rights on which the accused \nrely, the right to dignity and the right to life.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     119 E.g., Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 782 (1977)(imposition of the death penalty for rape violates due process \nguarantees because the sentence is grossly disproportionate punishment for a nonlethal offence).  See also, \nGregg v. Georgia, supra note 60, at 187 (\"[W]e must consider whether the punishment of death is \ndisproportionate in relation to the crime for which it is imposed.\"), and Furman v. Georgia, supra note 34, at 273 \n(\"...a punishment may be degrading simply by reason of its enormity.\"). \n\n     120 The Black Act: 9 George I. C.22, as cited in E.P. THOMPSON, WHIGS AND HUNTERS, THE ORIGIN OF THE \nBLACK ACT 211 (Pantheon).  The author notes that these provisions were described by Lord Chief Justice \nHardwicke as \"necessary for the present state and condition of things and to suppress mischiefs, which were \ngrowing frequent among us.\" \n\n     121 This was the approach of Brennan, J., in Furman v. Georgia, supra note 34, at 282 (\"The test, then, will \nordinarily be a cumulative one:  If a punishment is unusually severe, if there is a strong probability that it is \ninflicted arbitrarily, if it is substantially rejected by contemporary society [a  determination he makes based on \nthe infrequency of use in relation to the number of offences for which such punishment may apply], and if there \nis no reason to believe that it serves any penal purpose more effectively than some less severe punishment, then \nthe continued infliction of that punishment violates the [clause prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment].\"). \n\n \n \n\n64 \n\n\f[95]  The carrying out of the death sentence destroys life, which is protected without \n\nreservation under section 9 of our Constitution, it annihilates human dignity which is \nprotected under section 10, elements of arbitrariness are present in its enforcement \nand it is irremediable.  Taking these factors into account, as well as the assumption \nthat I have made in regard to public opinion in South Africa, and giving the words of \nsection 11(2) the broader meaning to which they are entitled at this stage of the \nenquiry, rather than a narrow meaning,122  I am satisfied that in the context of our \nConstitution the death penalty is indeed a cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. \n\n \nIs capital punishment for murder justifiable? \n \n[96]  The question that now has to be considered is whether the imposition of such \n\npunishment is nonetheless justifiable as a penalty for murder in the circumstances \ncontemplated by sections 277(1)(a), 316A and 322(2A) of the Criminal Procedure \nAct. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     122 S v Zuma and Two Others, supra note 6, para. 21. \n\n \n \n\n65 \n\n\f[97] \n\n \n[98] \n\nIt is difficult to conceive of any circumstances in which torture, which is specifically \nprohibited under section 11(2), could ever be justified.  But that does not necessarily \napply to capital punishment.  Capital punishment, unlike torture, has not been \nabsolutely prohibited by public international law.  It is therefore not inappropriate to \nconsider whether the death penalty is justifiable under our Constitution as a penalty \nfor murder.  This calls for an enquiry similar to that undertaken by Brennan J in \nFurman's case123 in dealing with the contention that \"death is a necessary punishment \nbecause it prevents the commission of capital crimes more effectively than any less \nsevere punishment.\"124  The same question is addressed and answered in the negative \nin the judgment of Wright CJ in People v Anderson.125  Under the United States \nConstitution and the Californian Constitution, which have no limitation clauses, this \nenquiry had to be conducted within the larger question of the definition of the right.  \nWith us, however, the question has to be dealt with under section 33(1).  \n\nSection 33(1) of the Constitution provides, in part, that: \n \n\n     \n\nThe rights entrenched in this Chapter may be limited by law of general application, \nprovided that such limitation- \n(a) \n\nshall be permissible only to the extent that it is- \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nreasonable;  and \njustifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom \nand equality;  and \n\n                                                 \n     123 Furman v. Georgia, supra note 34, at 300.  Brennan, J., was dealing here with the proposition that \"an \nunusually severe and degrading punishment may not be excessive in view of the purposes for which it is \ninflicted.\"  \n\n     124 Id. \n\n     125 \"The People concede that capital punishment is cruel to the individual involved.  They argue, however, \nthat only \"unnecessary\" cruelty is constitutionally proscribed, and that if a cruel punishment can be justified it is \nnot forbidden by article I, section 6, of the California Constitution.\"  Supra note 62, at 895. \n\n \n \n\n66 \n\n\f     \n\n(b) \n\nshall not negate the essential content of the right in question. \n\n \n[99] \n\nSection 33(1)(b) goes on to provide that the limitation of certain rights, including the \nrights referred to in section 10 and section 11 \"shall, in addition to being reasonable \nas required in paragraph (a)(I), also be necessary.\" \n\n \nThe Two-Stage Approach \n \n\n[100]  Our Constitution deals with the limitation of rights through a general limitations clause.  As \n\nwas pointed out by Kentridge AJ in Zuma's case,126 this calls for a \"two-stage\" \napproach, in which a broad rather than a narrow interpretation is given to the \nfundamental rights enshrined in Chapter Three, and limitations have to be justified \nthrough the application of section 33.  In this it differs from the Constitution of the \nUnited States, which does not contain a limitation clause, as a result of which courts \nin that country have been obliged to find limits to constitutional rights through a \nnarrow interpretation of the rights themselves.  Although the \"two-stage\" approach \nmay often produce the same result as the \"one-stage\" approach,127 this will not always \nbe the case. \n\n \n[101]  The practical consequences of this difference in approach are evident in the present case.  In \n\nGregg v. Georgia, the conclusion reached in the judgment of the plurality was \nsummed up as follows: \n\n \n\n                                                 \n     126 S v Zuma and Two Others, supra note 6. \n\n     127 Attorney-General of Hong Kong v Lee Kwong-Kut, (1993) AC 951 at 970-972 (PC).  \n\n \n \n\n67 \n\n\fIn sum, we cannot say that the judgment of the Georgia legislature that capital \npunishment may be necessary in some cases is clearly wrong.  Considerations of \nfederalism, as well as respect for the ability of a legislature to evaluate, in terms of its \nparticular state the moral consensus concerning the death penalty and its social utility \nas a sanction, require us to conclude in the absence of more convincing evidence, that \nthe infliction of death as a punishment for murder is not without justification, and is \nthus not unconstitutionally severe.128 \n\n \n[102]  Under our Constitution, the position is different.  It is not whether the decision of the State \n\nhas been shown to be clearly wrong; it is whether the decision of the State is \njustifiable according to the criteria prescribed by section 33.  It is not whether the \ninfliction of death as a punishment for murder \"is not without justification\", it is \nwhether the infliction of death as a punishment for murder has been shown to be both \nreasonable and necessary, and to be consistent with the other requirements of section \n33.  It is for the legislature, or the party relying on the legislation, to establish this \njustification, and not for the party challenging it to show that it was not justified.129 \n\n \nThe Application of Section 33 \n \n[103]  The criteria prescribed by section 33(1) for any limitation of  the rights contained in section \n\n11(2) are that the limitation must be justifiable in an open and democratic society \nbased on freedom and equality, it must be both reasonable and necessary and it must \nnot negate the essential content of the right.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n     128 Supra note 60, at 186-187. \n\n     129 S v Zuma and Two Others, supra note 6. \n\n \n \n\n68 \n\n\f[104]  The limitation of constitutional rights for a purpose that is reasonable and necessary in a \n\ndemocratic society involves the weighing up of competing values, and ultimately an \nassessment based on proportionality.130  This is implicit in the provisions of section \n33(1).  The fact that different rights have different implications for democracy, and in \nthe case of our Constitution,  for \"an open and democratic society based on freedom \nand equality\", means that there is no absolute standard which can be laid down for \ndetermining reasonableness and necessity.  Principles can be established, but the \napplication of those principles to particular circumstances can only be done on a case \nby case basis.  This is inherent in the requirement of proportionality, which calls for \nthe balancing of different interests.  In the balancing process, the relevant \nconsiderations will include the nature of the right that is limited, and its importance to \nan open and democratic society based on freedom and equality; the purpose for which \nthe right is limited and the importance of that purpose to such a society; the extent of \nthe limitation, its efficacy, and particularly where the limitation has to be necessary, \nwhether the desired ends could reasonably be achieved through other means less \ndamaging to the right in question.  In the process regard must be had to the provisions \nof section 33(1), and the underlying values of the Constitution, bearing in mind that, \nas a Canadian Judge has said, \"the role of the Court is not to second-guess the wisdom \nof policy choices made by legislators.\"131  \n\n \nLimitation of Rights in Canada \n\n                                                 \n\n     130 A proportionality test is applied to the limitation of fundamental rights by the Canadian courts, the \nGerman Federal Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights. Although the approach of these \nCourts to proportionality is not identical, all recognise that proportionality is an essential requirement of any \nlegitimate limitation of an entrenched right. Proportionality is also inherent in the different levels of scrutiny \napplied by United States courts to governmental action. \n\n     131 Reference re ss. 193 and 195(1)(c) of the Criminal Code of Manitoba, infra note 135. \n\n \n \n\n69 \n\n\f[105]  In dealing with this aspect of the case, Mr Trengove placed considerable reliance on the \n\ndecision of the Canadian Supreme Court in R v Oakes.132  The Canadian Charter of \nRights, as our Constitution does, makes provision for the limitation of rights through \na general clause.  Section 1 of the Charter permits such reasonable limitations of \nCharter rights \"as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\"  In \nOakes' case it was held that in order to meet this requirement a limitation of a Charter \nright had to be directed to the achievement of an objective of sufficient importance to \nwarrant the limitation of the right in question, and that there had also to be \nproportionality between the limitation and such objective.  In a frequently-cited \npassage, Dickson CJC described the components of proportionality as follows: \n\n \n\nThere are, in my view, three important components of a proportionality test.  First, \nthe measures adopted must be carefully designed to achieve the objective in question. \nThey must not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations.  In short, they \nmust be rationally connected to the objective.  Second, the means, even if rationally \nconnected to the objective in this first sense, should impair \"as little as possible\" the \nright or freedom in question:  R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd. at p. 352.  Third, there must \nbe a proportionality between the effects of the measures which are responsible for \nlimiting the Charter right or freedom, and the objective which has been identified as \nof \"sufficient importance\".133  \n\n \n\n[106]  Although there is a rational connection between capital punishment and the purpose for \n\nwhich it is prescribed, the elements of arbitrariness, unfairness and irrationality in the \nimposition of the penalty, are factors that would have to be taken into account in the \napplication of the first component of this test.  As far as the second component is \nconcerned, the fact that a severe punishment in the form of life imprisonment is \navailable as an alternative sentence, would be relevant to the question whether the \ndeath sentence impairs the right as little as possible.  And as I will show later, if all \nrelevant considerations are taken into account, it is at least doubtful whether a \n\n                                                 \n     132 (1986) 19 CRR 308. \n\n     133 Id. at 337. \n\n \n \n\n70 \n\n\fsentence of capital punishment for murder would satisfy the third component of the \nOakes test. \n\n \n[107]  The second requirement of the Oakes test, that the limitation should impair the right \"as little \n\nas possible\" raises a fundamental problem of judicial review.  Can, and should, an \nunelected court substitute its own opinion of what is reasonable or necessary for that \nof an elected legislature?  Since the judgment in R v Oakes, the Canadian Supreme \nCourt has shown that it is sensitive to this tension, which is particularly acute where \nchoices have to be made in respect of matters of policy.  In Irwin Toy Ltd v Quebec \n(Attorney General),134 Dickson CJ cautioned that courts, \"must be mindful of the \nlegislature's representative function.\"   In Reference re ss. 193 and 195 (1)(c) of the \nCriminal Code (Manitoba),135 it was said that \"the role of the Court is not to second-\nguess the wisdom of policy choices made by ...legislators\"; and in R v Chaulk, that \nthe means must impair the right \"as little as is reasonably possible\".136  Where choices \nhave to be made between \"differing reasonable policy  options\", the courts will allow \nthe government the deference due to legislators, but \"[will] not give them an \nunrestricted licence to disregard an individual's Charter Rights.  Where the \ngovernment cannot show that it had a reasonable basis for concluding that it has \ncomplied with the requirement of minimal impairment in seeking to attain its \nobjectives, the legislation will be struck down.\"137  \n\n \nLimitation of Rights in Germany \n                                                 \n\n     134 (1989) 39 CRR 193 at 248. \n\n     135 (1990) 48 CRR 1 at 62. \n\n     136 (1991) 1 CRR (2d) 1 at 30. \n\n     137 Per La Forest J in Tetreault-Gadoury v Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission) (1991), 4 \nCRR(2d) 12 at 26.

According to Professor Grimm,138 the Federal \nConstitutional Court allows such limitation \"only in order to make conflicting rights \ncompatible or to protect the rights of other persons or important community \ninterests...any restriction of human rights not only needs constitutionally valid \nreasons but also has to be proportional to the rank and importance of the right at \nstake.\"  Proportionality is central to the process followed by the Federal \nConstitutional Court in its adjudication upon the limitation of rights.  The Court has \nregard to the purpose of the limiting legislation, whether the legislation is suitable for \nthe achievement of such purpose, which brings into consideration whether it in fact \nachieves that purpose, is necessary therefor, and whether a proper balance has been \nachieved between the purpose enhanced by the limitation, and the fundamental right \nthat has been limited.139  The German Constitution also has a provision similar to \nsection 33(1)(b) of our Constitution, but the Court apparently avoids making use of \nthis provision,140 preferring to deal with extreme limitations of rights through the \n\n                                                 \n\n     138 Dieter Grimm, Human Rights and Judicial Review in Germany, in HUMAN RIGHTS AND JUDICIAL REVIEW: \nA COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE 267, 275 (David H.

Prof. Currie outlines the genesis of proportionality, intimated in the Magna Carta and \ngenerally described by Blackstone, and notes that it was further developed by Carl Gottleib Svarez, a celebrated \nthinker of the German Enlightenment.  \"Svarez insisted on proportionality both between ends and means and \nbetween costs and benefits; both aspects of the principle are reflected in the jurisprudence of the Constitutional \nCourt.\"  Currie at 307. \n\n     140 Currie, id., at 178, note 15 and accompanying text.

The proportionality test of the \nEuropean Court of Human Rights calls for a balancing of ends and means.  The end \nmust be a \"pressing social need\" and the means used must be proportionate to the \nattainment of such an end.  The limitation of certain rights is conditioned upon the \nlimitation being \"necessary in a democratic society\" for purposes defined in the \nrelevant provisions of the Convention.  The national authorities are allowed a \ndiscretion by the European Court of Human Rights in regard to what is necessary - a \nmargin of appreciation - but not unlimited power.  The \"margin of appreciation\" that \nis allowed varies depending upon the nature of the right and the nature and ambit of \nthe restriction.  A balance has to be achieved between the general interest, and the \ninterest of the individual.141  Where the limitation is to a right fundamental to \ndemocratic society, a higher standard of justification is required;142 so too, where a \nlaw interferes with the \"intimate aspects of private life.\"143  On the other hand, in \nareas such as morals or social policy greater scope is allowed to the national \nauthorities.144  The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights provides \nsome guidance as to what may be considered necessary in a democratic society, but \nthe margin of appreciation allowed to national authorities by the European Court \nmust be understood as finding its place in an international agreement which has to \naccommodate the sovereignty of the member states.  It is not necessarily a safe guide \nas to what would be appropriate under section 33 of our Constitution. \n\n                                                 \n\n     141 R v France (1993) 16 EHRR 1, para. 63.  \n\n     142 Handyside v United Kingdom (1979-80) 1 EHRR 737, para. 49. \n\n     143 Dudgeon v United Kingdom (1981) 4 EHRR 149, para. 52; Norris v Ireland (1988) 13 EHRR 186, para. \n46; Modinos v Cyprus (1993) 16 EHRR 485. \n\n     144 \"...[T]he margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies \nshould be a wide one...\"  James v United Kingdom (1986) 8 EHRR 123, para. 46.

This is equally true of the criteria developed by other courts, such as the \nGerman Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights.  Like \nKentridge AJ, \"I see no reason in this case... to attempt to fit our analysis into the \nCanadian pattern,\"145 or for that matter to fit it into the pattern followed by any of the \nother courts to which reference has been made.  Section 33 prescribes in specific \nterms the criteria to be applied for the limitation of different categories of rights and it \nis in the light of these criteria that the death sentence for murder has to be justified. \n\n \n[111]  \"Every person\" is entitled to claim the protection of the rights enshrined in Chapter Three, \nand \"no\" person shall be denied the protection that they offer.  Respect for life and \ndignity which are at the heart of section 11(2) are values of the highest order under \nour Constitution.  The carrying out of the death penalty would destroy these and all \nother rights that the convicted person has, and a clear and convincing case must be \nmade out to justify such action. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n     145 S v Zuma and Two Others, supra note 122, para. 35. \n\n \n \n\n74 \n\n\f[112]  The  Attorney General contended that the imposition of the death penalty for murder in the \n\nmost serious cases could be justified according to the prescribed criteria.  The \nargument went as follows.  The death sentence meets the sentencing requirements for \nextreme cases of murder more effectively than any other sentence can do.  It has a \ngreater deterrent effect than life imprisonment; it ensures that the worst murderers \nwill not endanger the lives of prisoners and warders who would be at risk if the \n\"worst of the murderers\" were to be imprisoned and not executed; and it also meets \nthe need for retribution which is demanded by society as a response to the high level \nof crime.  In the circumstances presently prevailing in the country, it is therefore a \nnecessary component of the criminal justice system.  This, he said, is recognised by \nthe Appellate Division, which only confirms a death sentence if it is convinced that \nno other sentence would be a proper sentence.146  \n\n \nThe Judgements of the Appellate Division \n \n[113]  The decisions of the Appellate Division to which the Attorney General referred are only of \nlimited relevance to the questions that have to be decided in the present case.  The \nlaw which the Appellate Division has applied prescribes that the death sentence is a \ncompetent sentence for murder in a proper case.  The Appellate Division has reserved \nthis sentence for extreme cases in which the maximum punishment would be the \nappropriate punishment.  Were it to have done otherwise, and to have refused to pass \ndeath sentences, it would in effect have been saying that the death sentence is never a \nproper sentence, and that section 277(1)(a) should not be enforced.  This was not \nwithin its competence.  The criteria set by the Appellate Division for the passing of a \ndeath sentence for murder are relevant to the argument on arbitrariness, and also \nprovide a basis for testing the justifiability of such a penalty.  They do not, however, \ndo more than that. \n\n \nThe Judgement of the Tanzanian Court of Appeal \n \n                                                 \n\n     146 S v Senonohi, supra note 76, at 734F-G. \n\n \n \n\n75 \n\n\f[114]  There is support for part of the Attorney General's argument in the judgment of the \n\nTanzanian Court of Appeal in Mbushuu and Another v The Republic.147  It was held \nin this case that the death sentence amounted to cruel and degrading punishment, \nwhich is prohibited under the Tanzanian Constitution, but that despite this finding, it \nwas not unconstitutional. The Constitution authorised derogations to be made from \nbasic rights for legitimate purposes, and a derogation was lawful if it was not \narbitrary, and was reasonably necessary for such purpose.  The legitimate purposes to \nwhich the death sentence was directed was a constitutional requirement that \n\"everyone's right to life shall be protected by law.\"  The death sentence was a \nmandatory penalty for murder, but it was not considered by the Court to be arbitrary \nbecause decisions as to guilt or innocence are taken by judges. There was no proof \none way or the other that the death sentence was necessarily a more effective \npunishment than a long period of imprisonment.  In the view of the Court, however, it \nwas for society and not the courts to decide whether the death sentence was a \nnecessary punishment.  The Court was satisfied that society favoured the death \nsentence, and that in the circumstances \"the reasonable and necessary\" standard had \nbeen met.  Accordingly, it held that the death sentence was a lawful derogation from \nthe prohibition of cruel and degrading punishment, and thus valid.   \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n     147 Criminal Appeal No. 142 of 1994; 30 January 1995. \n\n \n \n\n76 \n\n\f[115]  The approach of the Tanzanian Court of Appeal to issues concerning the limitation of basic \n\nrights seems to have been influenced by the language of the Tanzanian \nConstitution,148 and rules of interpretation developed by the Courts to deal with that \nlanguage.  The relevant provisions of our Constitution are different and the correct \napproach to the interpretation of the limitations clause must be found in the language \nof section 33 construed in the context of the Constitution as a whole.  It is for the \nCourt, and not society or Parliament, to decide whether the death sentence is \njustifiable under the provisions of section 33 of our Constitution.149  In doing so we \ncan have regard to societal attitudes in evaluating whether the legislation is \nreasonable and necessary, but ultimately the decision must be ours.  If the decision of \nthe Tanzanian Court of Appeal is inconsistent with this conclusion, I must express my \ndisagreement with it. \n\n \n\nDeterrence \n\n \n[116]  The Attorney General attached considerable weight to the need for a deterrent to violent \n\ncrime.  He argued that the countries which had abolished the death penalty were on \nthe whole developed and peaceful countries in which other penalties might be \nsufficient deterrents.  We had not reached that stage of development, he said.  If in \nyears to come we did so, we could do away with the death penalty.  Parliament could \ndecide when that time has come.  At present, however, so the argument went, the \ndeath sentence is an indispensable weapon if we are serious about combatting violent \ncrime. \n\n                                                 \n\n     148 Id., wherein Ramadhani JA., highlights with respect to the Republic of Tanzania Constitution, that article \n30(2) provides that laws, and actions taken in accordance with such laws, shall not be invalidated under the \nConstitution if such laws (or actions) make provision, inter alia, for \"ensuring that the rights and freedom of \nother or the public interest are not prejudiced by the misuse of the individual rights and freedom.\" Id. at p. 23.  \nThe judgment refers to \"derogations\" and not to \"limitations\". \n\n     149 See discussion on public opinion supra paras. 87 to 89. \n\n \n \n\n77 \n\n\f[117]  The need for a strong deterrent to violent crime is an end the validity of which is not open to \nquestion.  The state is clearly entitled, indeed obliged, to take action to protect human \nlife against violation by others.  In all societies there are laws which regulate the \nbehaviour of people and which authorise the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions \non those who act unlawfully.  This is necessary for the preservation and protection of \nsociety.  Without law, society cannot exist.  Without law, individuals in society have \nno rights.  The level of violent crime in our country has reached alarming proportions. \n It poses a threat to the transition to democracy, and the creation of development \nopportunities for all, which are primary goals of the Constitution.  The high level of \nviolent crime is a matter of common knowledge and is amply borne out by the \nstatistics provided by the Commissioner of Police in his amicus brief.  The power of \nthe State to impose sanctions on those who break the law cannot be doubted.  It is of \nfundamental importance to the future of our country that respect for the law should be \nrestored, and that dangerous criminals should be apprehended and dealt with firmly.  \nNothing in this judgment should be understood as detracting in any way from that \nproposition.  But the question is not whether criminals should go free and be allowed \nto escape the consequences of their anti-social behaviour.  Clearly they should not; \nand equally clearly those who engage in violent crime should be met with the full \nrigour of the law.  The question is whether the death sentence for murder can \nlegitimately be made part of that law. And this depends on whether it meets the \ncriteria prescribed by section 33(1). \n\n \n[118]  The Attorney General pointed to the substantial increase in the incidence of violent crime \nover the past five years during which the death sentence has not been enforced.  He \ncontended that this supported his argument that imprisonment is not a sufficient \ndeterrent, and that we have not yet reached the stage of development where we can do \nwithout the death sentence.  Throughout this period, however, the death sentence \nremained a lawful punishment, and was in fact imposed by the courts although the \nsentences were not carried out.150  The moratorium was only announced formally on \n\n                                                 \n\n     150 S v W 1993(2) SACR 74, at 76H-I.  \n\n \n \n\n78 \n\n\f27 March 1992.151  A decision could have been taken at any time to terminate the \nmoratorium on executions, and none of the criminals had any assurance that the \nmoratorium would still be in place if they were to be caught, brought to trial, \nconvicted and sentenced to death. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n     151 In the Statement of Minister of Justice dated 27 March 1992, supra note 31, para. 22. \n\n \n \n\n79 \n\n\f[119]  The cause of the high incidence of violent crime cannot simply be attributed to the failure to \n\ncarry out the death sentences imposed by the courts.  The upsurge in violent crime \ncame at a time of great social change associated with political turmoil and conflict, \nparticularly during the period 1990 to 1994.  It is facile to attribute the increase in \nviolent crime during this period to the moratorium on executions.152  It was a \nprogression that started before the moratorium was announced.  There are many \nfactors that have to be taken into account in looking for the cause of this \nphenomenon.  It is a matter of common knowledge that the political conflict during \nthis period, particularly in Natal and the Witwatersrand, resulted in violence and \ndestruction of a kind not previously experienced.  No-go areas, random killings on \ntrains, attacks and counter attacks upon political opponents, created a violent and \nunstable environment, manipulated by political dissidents and criminal elements \nalike. \n\n \n[120]  Homelessness, unemployment, poverty and the frustration consequent upon such conditions \n\nare other causes of the crime wave. And there is also the important factor that the \npolice and prosecuting authorities have been unable to cope with this. The statistics \npresented in the police amicus brief show that most violent crime is not solved, and \nthe Attorney General confirmed that the risk of a criminal being apprehended and \nconvicted for such offences is somewhere between 30 and 40 per cent.  Throughout \nthe period referred to by the Attorney General the death sentence remained on the \nstatute book and was imposed on convicted murderers when the Courts considered it \nappropriate to do so. \n\n \n[121]  We would be deluding ourselves if we were to believe that the execution of the few persons \nsentenced to death during this period, and of a comparatively few other people each \nyear from now onwards will provide the solution to the unacceptably high rate of \ncrime.  There will always be unstable, desperate, and pathological people for whom \n\n                                                 \n\n     152 Indeed, such a hypothesis is not born out by the statistics analysed by Justice Didcott in his concurring \nopinion at para 182. \n\n \n \n\n80 \n\n\fthe risk of arrest and imprisonment provides no deterrent, but there is nothing to show \nthat a decision to carry out the death sentence would have any impact on the \nbehaviour of such people, or that there will be more of them if imprisonment is the \nonly sanction.  No information was placed before us by the Attorney General in \nregard to the rising crime rate other than the bare statistics, and they alone prove \nnothing, other than that we are living in a violent society in which most crime goes \nunpunished - something that we all know. \n\n \n[122]  The greatest deterrent to crime is the likelihood that offenders will be apprehended, \n\nconvicted and punished. It is that which is presently lacking in our criminal justice \nsystem; and it is at this level and through addressing the causes of crime that the State \nmust seek to combat lawlessness.  \n\n \n[123]  In the debate as to the deterrent effect of the death sentence, the issue is sometimes dealt with \n\nas if the choice to be made is between the death sentence and the murder going \nunpunished.  That is of course not so. The choice to be made is between putting the \ncriminal to death and subjecting the criminal to the severe punishment of a long term \nof imprisonment which, in an appropriate case, could be a sentence of life \nimprisonment.153  Both are deterrents, and the question is whether the possibility of \nbeing sentenced to death, rather than being sentenced to life imprisonment, has a \nmarginally greater deterrent effect, and whether the Constitution sanctions the \nlimitation of rights affected thereby. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n     153 Since 1991, section 64 of the Correctional Service Act 8 of 1959 has provided that a person sentenced to \nlife imprisonment may only be released from prison in the following circumstances:  (a) the advisory release \nboard \"with due regard to the interest of society\", recommends that the prisoner be released and (b) the Minister \nof Correctional Services accepts that recommendation and authorizes the release of the prisoner.  This means \nthat the Minister of Correctional Services must accept responsibility for the release of the prisoner, and can only \ndo so if the advisory release board is in favour of the prisoner being released. \n\n \n \n\n81 \n\n\f[124]  In the course of his argument the Attorney General contended that if sentences imposed by \n\nthe Courts on convicted criminals are too lenient, the law will be brought into \ndisrepute, and members of society will then take the law into their own hands.  Law is \nbrought into disrepute if the justice system is ineffective and criminals are not \npunished.  But if the justice system is effective and criminals are apprehended, \nbrought to trial and in serious cases subjected to severe sentences, the law will not \nfall into disrepute.   We have made the commitment to \"a future founded on the \nrecognition of human rights, democracy and peaceful co-existence...for all South \nAfricans.\"154  Respect for life and dignity lies at the heart of that commitment.  One \nof the reasons for the prohibition of capital punishment is \"that allowing the State to \nkill will cheapen the value of human life and thus [through not doing so] the State \nwill serve in a sense as a role model for individuals in society.\"155  Our country needs \nsuch role models. \n\n \n[125]  The Attorney General also contended that if even one innocent life should be saved by the \nexecution of perpetrators of vile murders, this would provide sufficient justification \nfor the death penalty.156  The hypothesis that innocent lives might be saved must be \nweighed against the values underlying the Constitution, and the ability of the State to \nserve \"as a role model\".  In the long run more lives may be saved through the \ninculcation of a rights culture, than through the execution of murderers. \n\n \n[126]  The death sentence has been reserved for the most extreme cases, and the overwhelming \n\nmajority of convicted murderers are not and, since extenuating circumstances became \na relevant factor sixty years ago, have not been sentenced to death in South Africa.  I \n\n                                                 \n\n     154 This statement is taken from the provision on National Reconciliation. \n\n     155 Sopinka J (La Forest, Gonthier, Iacobucci and Major JJ, concurring) in Rodriquez v British Columbia \n(1994) 17 CRR(2d) 193 at 218.     \n\n     156 This proposition is advanced in greater detail by J Price, (1995) \"De Rebus\" 89. \n\n \n \n\n82 \n\n\freferred earlier to the figures provided by the Attorney General which show that \nbetween the amendment of the Criminal Procedure Act in 1990, and January 1995, \nwhich is the date of his written argument in the present case, 243 death sentences \nwere imposed, of which 143 were confirmed by the Appellate Division.  Yet, \naccording to statistics placed before us by the Commissioner of Police and the \nAttorney General, there were on average approximately 20 000 murders committed, \nand 9 000  murder cases brought to trial, each year during this period.  Would the \ncarrying out of the death sentence on these 143 persons have deterred the other \nmurderers or saved any lives?  \n\n \n[127]  It was accepted by the Attorney General that this is a much disputed issue in the literature on \n\nthe death sentence.  He contended that it is common sense that the most feared \npenalty will provide the greatest deterrent, but accepted that there is no proof that the \ndeath sentence is in fact a greater deterrent than life imprisonment for a long period.  \nIt is, he said, a proposition that is not capable of proof, because one never knows \nabout those who have been deterred; we know only about those who have not been \ndeterred, and who have committed terrible crimes.  This is no doubt true, and the fact \nthat there is no proof that the death sentence is a greater deterrent than imprisonment \ndoes not necessarily mean that the requirements of section 33 cannot be met.  It is, \nhowever, a major obstacle in the way of the Attorney General's argument, for he has \nto satisfy us that the penalty is reasonable and necessary, and the doubt which exists \nin regard to the deterrent effect of the sentence must weigh heavily against his \nargument.   \"A punishment as extreme and as irrevocable as death cannot be \npredicated upon speculation as to what the deterrent effect might be...\"157  I should \nadd that this obstacle would not be removed by the implementation of a suggestion in \none of the amicus briefs, that section 277(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act should be \nmade more specific, and should identify the extreme categories of murder for which \nthe death sentence would be a permissible punishment. \n\n \n\nPrevention \n\n                                                 \n\n     157 Wright, CJ., in People v. Anderson, supra note 62, at 897. \n\n \n \n\n83 \n\n\f \n[128]  Prevention is another object of punishment.  The death sentence ensures that the criminal \n\nwill never again commit murders, but it is not the only way of doing so, and life \nimprisonment also serves this purpose.  Although there are cases of gaol murders, \nimprisonment is regarded as sufficient for the purpose of prevention in the \noverwhelming number of cases in which there are murder convictions, and there is \nnothing to suggest that it is necessary for this purpose in the few cases in which death \nsentences are imposed. \n\n \n\nRetribution \n\n \n[129]  Retribution is one of the objects of punishment, but it carries less weight than deterrence.158  \n\nThe righteous anger of family and friends of the murder victim, reinforced by the \npublic abhorrence of vile crimes, is easily translated into a call for vengeance.  But \ncapital punishment is not the only way that society has of expressing its moral \noutrage at the crime that has been committed.  We have long outgrown the literal \napplication of the biblical injunction of \"an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth\".  \nPunishment must to some extent be commensurate with the offence, but there is no \nrequirement that it be equivalent or identical to it.  The state does not put out the eyes \nof a person who has blinded another in a vicious assault, nor does it punish a rapist, \nby castrating him and submitting him to the utmost humiliation in gaol.  The state \ndoes not need to engage in the cold and calculated killing of murderers in order to \nexpress moral outrage at their conduct.  A very long prison sentence is also a way of \nexpressing outrage and visiting retribution upon the criminal. \n\n \n[130]  Retribution ought not to be given undue weight in the balancing process.  The Constitution is \n\npremised on the assumption that ours will be a constitutional state founded on the \nrecognition of human rights.159  The concluding provision on National Unity and \n\n                                                 \n\n     158 S v P 1991 (1) SA 517 (A) at 523D-F.  See also supra note 74. \n\n     159 The Preamble to the Constitution records that the new order will be a \"constitutional state in which...all \ncitizens shall be able to enjoy and exercise their fundamental rights and freedoms.\"  The commitment to \nrecognition of human rights is reaffirmed in the concluding provision on National Unity and Reconciliation. \n\n \n \n\n84 \n\n\f \n\n \n\nReconciliation contains the following commitment: \n\nThe adoption of this Constitution lays the secure foundation for the people of South \nAfrica to transcend the divisions and strife of the past, which generated gross \nviolations of human rights, the transgression of humanitarian principles in violent \nconflicts and a legacy of hatred, fear, guilt and revenge. \n\nThese can now be addressed on the basis that there is a need for understanding but \nnot for vengeance, a need for reparation but not for retaliation, a need for ubuntu but \nnot for victimisation. (Emphasis supplied) \n\n \n[131]  Although this commitment has its primary application in the field of political reconciliation, \n\nit is not without relevance to the enquiry we are called upon to undertake in the \npresent case.  To be consistent with the value of ubuntu ours should be a society that \n\"wishes to prevent crime...[not] to kill criminals simply to get even with them.\"160  \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nThe Essential Content of the Right \n\n                                                 \n\n     160 Brennan, J., in Furman v. Georgia, supra note 34, at 305. \n\n \n \n\n85 \n\n\f[132]  Section 33(1)(b) provides that a limitation shall not negate the essential content of the right.  \n\nThere is uncertainty in the literature concerning the meaning of this provision.  It \nseems to have entered constitutional law through the provisions of the German \nConstitution, and in addition to the South African constitution, appears, though not \nprecisely in the same form, in the constitutions of Namibia, Hungary, and possibly \nother countries as well.  The difficulty of interpretation arises from the uncertainty as \nto what the \"essential content\" of a right is, and how it is to be determined.  Should \nthis be determined subjectively from the point of view of the individual affected by \nthe invasion of the right, or objectively, from the point of view of the nature of the \nright and its place in the constitutional order, or possibly in some other way?  \nProfessor Currie draws attention to the large number of theories which have been \npropounded by German scholars as to the how the \"essence\" of a right should be \ndiscerned and how the constitutional provision should be applied.161  The German \nFederal Constitutional Court has apparently avoided to a large extent having to deal \nwith this issue by subsuming the enquiry into the proportionality test that it applies \nand the precise scope and meaning of the provision is controversial.162 \n\n \n[133]  If the essential content of the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading \npunishment is to be found in respect for life and dignity, the death sentence for \nmurder, if viewed subjectively from the point of view of the convicted prisoner, \nclearly negates the essential content of the right.  But if it is viewed objectively from \n\n                                                 \n\n     161 Currie, supra note 139, refers to an analysis of the 'remarkable variety of views' on the meaning of \n'essence'. Id. at 178 (citing 2 Maunz/Durig, Art. 19, Abs. II, Rdnr. 16). \n\n     162 Grimm, supra note 138, at page 276 states, \"operating at an earlier stage than the essential content limit in \nArticle 19(2), the proportionality principle has rendered the former almost insignificant.\"  Currie, supra note \n139, notes that the German Federal Constitutional Court has remarked in at least one case that dealt with the \n'essential content' question that the Court \"state[d] an alternative ground that, because of its greater stringency \n[the proportionality test], has made it unnecessary in most cases to inquire whether a restriction invades the \n'essential content' of a basic right.\"  Currie, supra note 139, at 306-307 (citing 22 BVerfGE 180, 220 (1967)). \n\n \n \n\n86 \n\n\fthe point of view of a constitutional norm that requires life and dignity to be \nprotected, the punishment does not necessarily negate the essential content of the \nright.  It has been argued before this Court that one of the purposes of such \npunishment is to protect the life and hence the dignity of innocent members of the \npublic, and if it in fact does so, the punishment will not negate the constitutional \nnorm.  On this analysis it would, however, have to be shown that the punishment \nserves its intended purpose.  This would involve a consideration of the deterrent and \npreventative effects of the punishment and whether they add anything to the \nalternative of life imprisonment.  If they do not, they cannot be said to serve a life \nprotecting purpose.  If the negation is viewed both objectively and subjectively, the \nostensible purpose of the punishment would have to be weighed against the \ndestruction of the individual's life.  For the purpose of that analysis the element of \nretribution would have to be excluded and the \"life saving\" quality of the punishment \nwould have to be established.  \n\n \n[134]  It is, however, not necessary to solve this problem in the present case.  At the very least the \n\nprovision evinces concern that, under the guise of limitation, rights should not be \ntaken away altogether.  It was presumably the same concern that influenced Dickson \nCJC to say in R v Oakes that rights should be limited \"as little as possible\",163 and the \nGerman Constitutional Court to hold in the life imprisonment case that all possibility \nof parole ought not to be excluded.164 \n\n \nThe Balancing Process \n \n[135]  In the balancing process, deterrence, prevention and retribution must be weighed against the \n\nalternative punishments available to the state, and the factors which taken together \nmake capital punishment cruel, inhuman and degrading:  the destruction of life, the \n\n                                                 \n\n     163 R v Oakes, supra note 132, at 337 (citing R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at 352). \n\n     164 See Kommers supra note 18.  \n\n \n \n\n87 \n\n\fannihilation of dignity, the elements of arbitrariness, inequality and the possibility of \nerror in the enforcement of the penalty. \n\n \n[136]  The Attorney General argued that the right to life and the right to human dignity were not \n\nabsolute concepts.  Like all rights they have their limits.  One of those limits is that a \nperson who murders in circumstances where the death penalty is permitted by section \n277, forfeits his or her right to claim protection of life and dignity.  He sought to \nsupport this argument by reference to the principles of self-defence.  If the law \nrecognises the right to take the life of a wrongdoer in a situation in which self-\ndefence is justified, then, in order to deter others, and to ensure that the wrongdoer \ndoes not again kill an innocent person, why should it not recognise the power of the \nstate to take the life of a convicted murderer?  Conversely, if the death sentence \nnegates the essential content of the right to life, how can the taking of the life of \nanother person in self-defence, or even to protect the State itself during war or \nrebellion, ever be justified.  \n\n \n[137]  This argument is fallacious.  The rights vested in every person by Chapter Three of the \n\nConstitution are subject to limitation under section 33.  In times of emergency, some \nmay be suspended in accordance with the provisions of section 34 of the \nConstitution.165  But subject to this, the rights vest in every person, including \ncriminals convicted of vile crimes. Such criminals do not forfeit their rights under the \nConstitution and are entitled, as all in our country now are, to assert these rights, \nincluding the right to life, the right to dignity and the right not to be subjected to \ncruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.  Whether or not a particular punishment is \ninconsistent with these rights depends upon an interpretation of the relevant \nprovisions of the Constitution, and not upon a moral judgment that a murderer should \nnot be allowed to claim them. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n     165 Sections 8(2), 9, 10 and 11(2) are in fact non-derogable rights and in terms of section 34(5)(c) cannot be suspended \nduring an emergency. \n\n \n \n\n88 \n\n\f[138]  Self-defence is recognised by all legal systems.  Where a choice has to be made between the \nlives of two or more people, the life of the innocent is given preference over the life \nof the aggressor.  This is consistent with section 33(1).  To deny the innocent person \nthe right to act in self-defence would deny to that individual his or her right to life.  \nThe same is true where lethal force is used against a hostage taker who threatens the \nlife of the hostage.  It is permissible to kill the hostage taker to save the life of the \ninnocent hostage.  But only if the hostage is in real danger.  The law solves problems \nsuch as these through the doctrine of proportionality, balancing the rights of the \naggressor against the rights of the victim, and favouring the life or lives of innocents \nover the life or lives of the guilty.166  But there are strict limits to the taking of life, \neven in the circumstances that have been described, and the law insists upon these \nlimits being adhered to.  In any event, there are material respects in which killing in \nself-defence or necessity differ from the execution of a criminal by the State.  Self-\ndefence takes place at the time of the threat to the victim's life, at the moment of the \nemergency which gave rise to the necessity and, traditionally, under circumstances in \nwhich no less-severe alternative is readily available to the potential victim.  Killing \nby the State takes place long after the crime was committed, at a time when there is \nno emergency and under circumstances which permit the careful consideration of \nalternative punishment. \n\n                                                 \n\n     166 Self-defence is treated in our law as a species of private defence.  It is not necessary for the purposes of \nthis judgement to examine the limits of private defence.  Until now, our law has allowed killing in defence of \nlife, but also has allowed killing in defence of property, or other legitimate interest, in circumstances where it is \nreasonable and necessary to do so.  S v Van Wyk 1967 (1) SA 488 (A).  Whether this is consistent with the \nvalues of our new legal order is not a matter which arises for consideration in the present case.  What is material \nis that the law applies a proportionality test, weighing the interest protected against the interest of the \nwrongdoer.  These interests must now be weighed in the light of the Constitution. \n\n \n \n\n89 \n\n\f[139]  The examples of war and rebellion are also not true analogies.  War and rebellion are special \n\ncases which must be dealt with in terms of the legal principles governing such \nsituations.  It is implicit in any constitutional order that the State can act to put down \nrebellion and to protect itself against external aggression.  Where it is necessary in the \npursuit of such ends to kill in the heat of battle the taking of life is sanctioned under \nthe Constitution by necessary implication, and as such, is permissible in terms of \nsection 4(1).167  But here also there are limits.  Thus prisoners of war who have been \ncaptured and who are no longer a threat to the State cannot be put to death; nor can \nlethal force be used against rebels when it is not necessary to do so for the purposes \nof putting down the rebellion.    \n\n \n[140]  The case of a police officer shooting at an escaping criminal was also raised in argument.  \n\nThis is permitted under section 49(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act as a last resort if \nit is not possible to arrest the criminal in the ordinary way.  Once again, there are \nlimits.  It would not, for instance, be permissible to shoot at point blank range at a \ncriminal who has turned his or her back upon a police officer in order to abscond, \nwhen other methods of subduing and arresting the criminal are possible.  We are not \nconcerned here with the validity of section 49(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, and I \nspecifically refrain from expressing any view thereon.  Greater restriction on the use \nof lethal force may be one of the consequences of the establishment of a \nconstitutional state which respects every person's right to life.  Shooting at a fleeing \ncriminal in the heat of the moment, is not necessarily to be equated with the execution \nof a captured criminal.  But, if one of the consequences of this judgment might be to \n\n                                                 \n\n     167 \"The inherent right of the State to assume extraordinary powers and to use all means at its disposal in \norder to defend itself when its existence is at stake is recognized by our common law as an exceptional and \nextreme constitutional tool.\"  Per Selikowitz J in End Conscription Campaign v Minister of Defence 1989 (2) \nSA 180(C) at 199H.  Here too it is not necessary to examine the limits of this \"inherent right\", or the limitations \n(if any) imposed on it by the Constitution.  All that need be said is that it is of an entirely different character than \nthe alleged \"right\" of the State to execute murderers, and subject to different considerations. \n\n \n \n\n90 \n\n\frender the provisions of section 49(2) unconstitutional, the legislature will have to \nmodify the provisions of the section in order to bring it into line with the \nConstitution.  In any event, the constitutionality of the death sentence for murder does \nnot depend upon whether it is permissible for life to be taken in other circumstances \ncurrently sanctioned by law.  It depends upon whether it is justifiable as a penalty in \nterms of section 33 of the Constitution.  In deciding this question, the fact that the \nperson sentenced to death is denied his or her right to life is of the greatest \nimportance.  \n\n \n[141]  The Attorney General argued that all punishment involves an impairment of dignity.  \nImprisonment, which is the alternative to the death sentence, severely limits a \nprisoner's fundamental rights and freedoms.  There is only the barest freedom  of \nmovement or of residence in prison, and other basic rights such as freedom of \nexpression and  freedom of assembly are severely curtailed.   \n\n \n[142]  Dignity is inevitably impaired by imprisonment or any other punishment, and the undoubted \n\npower of the state to impose punishment as part of the criminal justice system, \nnecessarily involves the power to encroach upon a prisoner's dignity.  But a prisoner \ndoes not lose all his or her rights on entering prison.   \n\n[Prisoners retain] those absolute natural rights relating to personality, to which  \nevery man is entitled.  True [their] freedom had been greatly impaired by the legal \nprocess of imprisonment but they were entitled to demand respect for what \nremained.  The fact that their liberty had been legally curtailed could afford no \nexcuse for a further legal encroachment upon it. [It was] contended that the \n[prisoners] once in prison could claim only such rights as the Ordinance and the \nregulations conferred.  But the directly opposite view is surely the correct one.  \nThey were entitled to all their personal rights and personal dignity not temporarily \ntaken away by law, or necessarily inconsistent with the circumstances in which \nthey had been placed.168 \n\n                                                 \n\n     168 Innes J in Whittaker v Roos and Bateman 1912 AD 92 at 122-123.  See also, Goldberg and Others v \nMinister of Prisons and Others 1979 (1) SA 14 (A) at 39H-40C; Nestor and Others v Minister of Police and \nOthers 1984 (4) SA 230 (SWA) at 250F-251D. \n\n \n \n\n91 \n\n\f \n[143]  A prisoner is not stripped naked, bound, gagged and chained to his or her cell.  The right of \nassociation with other prisoners, the right to exercise, to write and receive letters and \nthe rights of personality referred to by Innes J are of vital importance to prisoners and \nhighly valued by them precisely because they are confined, have only limited contact \nwith the outside world, and are subject to prison discipline.  Imprisonment is a severe \npunishment; but prisoners retain all the rights to which every person is entitled under \nChapter Three subject only to limitations imposed by the prison regime that are \njustifiable under section 33.169  Of these, none are more important than the section \n11(2) right not to be subjected to \"torture of any kind...nor to cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading treatment or punishment.\"  There is a difference between encroaching \nupon rights for the purpose of punishment and destroying them altogether.  It is that \ndifference with which we are concerned in the present case. \n\n \n\nConclusion \n\n \n[144]  The rights to life and dignity are the most important of all human rights, and the source of all \nother personal rights in Chapter Three.  By committing ourselves to a society founded \non the recognition of human rights we are required to value these two rights above all \nothers.  And this must be demonstrated by the State in everything that it does, \nincluding the way it punishes criminals.  This is not achieved by objectifying \nmurderers and putting them to death to serve as an example to others in the \nexpectation that they might possibly be deterred thereby. \n\n \n[145]  In the balancing process the principal factors that have to be weighed are on the one hand the \n\ndestruction of life and dignity that is a consequence of the implementation of the \ndeath sentence, the elements of arbitrariness and the possibility of error in the \nenforcement of capital punishment, and the existence of a severe alternative \npunishment (life imprisonment) and, on the other, the claim that the death sentence is \n\n                                                 \n\n     169 See also, Woods v Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs and Others, 1995 BCLR 56(ZSC) \nat 58F-G; Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84-85 (1987). \n\n \n \n\n92 \n\n\fa greater deterrent to murder, and will more effectively prevent its commission, than \nwould a sentence of life imprisonment, and that there is a public demand for \nretributive justice to be imposed on murderers, which only the death sentence can \nmeet.  \n\n \n[146]  Retribution cannot be accorded the same weight under our Constitution as the rights to life \nand dignity, which are the most important of all the rights in Chapter Three.  It has \nnot been shown that the death sentence would be materially more effective to deter or \nprevent murder than the alternative sentence of life imprisonment would be.  Taking \nthese factors into account, as well as the elements of arbitrariness and the possibility \nof error in enforcing the death penalty, the clear and convincing case that is required \nto justify the death sentence as a penalty for murder, has not been made out.  The \nrequirements of section 33(1) have accordingly not been satisfied, and it follows that \nthe provisions of section 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 must be held \nto be inconsistent with section 11(2) of the Constitution.  In the circumstances, it is \nnot necessary for me to consider whether the section would also be inconsistent with \nsections 8, 9 or 10 of the Constitution if they had been dealt with separately and not \ntreated together as giving meaning to section 11(2). \n\n \n\nSection 241(8) of the Constitution \n\n \n[147]  In the present case the trial had been completed but an appeal to the Appellate Division was \npending, when the 1993 Constitution came into force.  The validity of the trial, and \nthe fact that the death sentences were competent sentences at the time they were \nimposed, are not in issue.  What is in issue before the Appellate Division is whether \nthe death sentences can and should be confirmed.  It has postponed its judgment \npending the determination of the issues referred to us for our decision. \n\n \n[148]  It is not necessary to deal with the provisions of section 241(8) in the present case.  The \n\nAttorney General correctly conceded that if the death penalty for murder is \nunconstitutional, it would not be competent to carry out the death sentences that have \nbeen imposed on the accused.  The prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading \n\n \n \n\n93 \n\n\fpunishment is applicable to all punishments implemented after the 27th April, and can \nbe invoked to prevent a punishment being carried out even if the punishment was \nlawful when it was imposed.170 \n\n \n\nThe Order to be made \n\n \n[149]  I have dealt in this judgment only with the provisions of section 277(1)(a) of the Criminal \n\nProcedure Act, but it is clear that if subsection (1)(a) is inconsistent with the \nConstitution, subsections (1)(c) to (1)(f) must also be unconstitutional, so too must \nprovisions of legislation corresponding to sections 277(1)(a), (c), (d), (e) and (f) that \nare in force in parts of the national territory in terms of section 229 of the \nConstitution.  Different considerations arising from section 33(1) might possibly \napply to subsection (b) which makes provision for the imposition of the death \nsentence for treason committed when the republic is in a state of war.  No argument \nwas addressed to us on this issue, and I refrain from expressing any views thereon. \n\n \n[150]  The proper sentence to be imposed on the accused is a matter for the Appellate Division and \nnot for us to decide.  This, and other capital cases which have been postponed by the \nAppellate Division pending the decision of this Court on the constitutionality of the \ndeath sentence, can now be dealt with in accordance with the order made in this case. \n Lest there be any doubt on this score, one of the effects of our judgment is to prohibit \nthe State, or any of its organs, from executing persons whose appeals against \nsentences of death have been disposed of.  Such persons will remain in custody under \nthe sentences imposed on them until such sentences have been set aside in accordance \nwith law, and substituted by appropriate and lawful punishments.  This will form part \nof the order made. \n\n \n[151]  The following order is made: \n\n                                                 \n\n     170 See Pratt v Attorney General for Jamaica; and Catholic Commission for Justice in Zimbabwe v The \nAttorney General, Zimbabwe, and Others, supra note 3. \n\n \n \n\n94 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nIn terms of section 98(5) of the Constitution, and with effect from the date of this \norder, the provisions of paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of section 277(1) of the \nCriminal Procedure Act, and all corresponding provisions of other legislation \nsanctioning capital punishment which are in force in any part of the national territory \nin terms of section 229, are declared to be inconsistent with the Constitution and, \naccordingly, to be invalid. \n\n2. \n\nIn terms of section 98(7) of the Constitution, and with effect from the date of this \norder: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nthe State is and all its organs are forbidden to execute any person already \nsentenced to death under any of the provisions thus declared to be invalid; and \n\nall such persons will remain in custody under the sentences imposed on them, \nuntil such sentences have been set aside in accordance with law and \nsubstituted by lawful punishments. \n\n \n \n[152]  ACKERMANN J:  I concur fully in the judgment of the President, both regarding his \n\nconclusions and his reasons therefor, save in the respects hereinafter set forth. I also \nagree with the order proposed by him. \n\n \n[153]  I place greater emphasis on the inevitably arbitrary nature of the decision involved in the \n\nimposition of the death penalty as a form of punishment in supporting the conclusion \nthat it constitutes \"cruel\", \"inhuman\" and \"degrading punishment\" within the meaning \nof section 11(2) of the Constitution, which cannot be saved by section 33(1). \n\n \n[154]  In paragraphs [43] to [56] of his judgment the President deals with the arbitrariness and \n\ninequality of the death penalty. He deals (more particularly in paragraphs [55] and \n[56]) with the difficulties faced by the US Supreme Court in trying to eliminate the \ndangers of arbitrariness by employing the due process provisions of the Fifth and \n\n \n \n\n95 \n\n\f \n \n\nACKERMANN J \n\nFourteenth Amendments. Such efforts cause considerable expense and interminable \ndelays, and the President concludes by expressing the view that we should not follow \nthe United States route. I agree, but that does not mean that we ought not to accord \ngreater weight to considerations of arbitrariness and inequality. The US Supreme \nCourt has been obliged to follow the route it did because, so it seems to me, their \nConstitution postulates (by implication) that it is possible to devise due process \nmechanisms which can deal with the arbitrary and unequal features of death sentence \nimposition. We are not so constrained. Our right to life is not qualified in the way it is \nqualified in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution. We are not \nconstitutionally constrained to accept the arbitrary consequences of the imposition of \nthe death penalty.   \n\n \n[155]  The preamble to the Constitution refers to the creation of a new order in a state, which, \n\namongst other things, is described as a \"constitutional state.\" Section 4(1) declares the \nConstitution to be the \"supreme law of the Republic\" which by virtue of section 4(2) \n\"binds all legislative, executive and judicial organs of state at all levels of \ngovernment.\" Every person's right to equality before the law is entrenched in section \n8(1) and in section 8(2) a substantial number of different grounds of unfair \ndiscrimination are prohibited. The constitutional importance of equality is further \nunderscored in section 35(1) which enjoins the courts to promote the values which \nunderlie an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality in \ninterpreting the provisions of Chapter 3. \n\n \n[156]  In reaction to our past, the concept and values of the constitutional state, of the \"regstaat\", \nand the constitutional right to equality before the law are deeply foundational to the \ncreation of the \"new order\" referred to in the preamble. The detailed enumeration and \ndescription in section 33(1) of the criteria which must be met before the legislature \ncan limit a right entrenched in Chapter 3 of the Constitution emphasises the \nimportance, in our new constitutional state, of reason and justification when rights are \nsought to be curtailed. We have moved from a past characterised by much which was \narbitrary and unequal in the operation of the law to a present and a future in a \n\n \n \n\n96 \n\n\f \n \n\nACKERMANN J \n\nconstitutional state where state action must be such that it is capable of being \nanalysed and justified rationally. The idea of the constitutional state presupposes a \nsystem whose operation can be rationally tested against or in terms of the law. \nArbitrariness, by its very nature, is dissonant with these core concepts of our new \nconstitutional order.  Neither arbitrary action nor laws or rules which are inherently \narbitrary or must lead to arbitrary application can, in any real sense, be tested against \nthe precepts or principles of the Constitution171. Arbitrariness must also inevitably, by \n\n                                                 \n\n     171See in general Prof. E Mureinik 'A Bridge to Where? Introducing the Interim Bill of Rights' 10 (1994) \nSAJHR 31. At 32 the learned author points out that - \n \n\n\"If the new Constitution is a bridge away from a culture of authority, it is clear what it must be \na bridge to. It must lead to a culture of justification - a culture in which every exercise of \npower is expected to be justified; ... If the Constitution is to be a bridge in this direction, it is \nplain that the Bill of Rights must be its chief strut\". \n\n \nAt 38 he points out that Chapter 3 of the Constitution, and in particular section 24, the administrative justice \nclause - \n \n\n\"gives a lead which, properly followed, would put South Africa at the frontiers of the search \nfor a culture of justification.\" \n\n \n \n\n97 \n\n\f \n \n\nACKERMANN J \n\nits very nature, lead to the unequal treatment of persons. Arbitrary action, or decision \nmaking, is incapable of providing a rational explanation as to why similarly placed \npersons are treated in a substantially different way. Without such a rational justifying \nmechanism, unequal treatment must follow. \n\n \n[157]  It is in the context of our (textually) unqualified section 9 right to life that I find certain \n\nobservations in the US decisions supportive on the issue and consequences of \narbitrariness. We are free to look at the incidence and consequences of arbitrariness \nwithout being constrained by a constitutional authorization (whether explicit or \nimplicit) of the death penalty. One must of course constantly bear in mind that the \nrelevant criteria in the Eighth Amendment of the US Constituion also differ from \nthose in section 11(2) of our Constitution. Whereas in the former they are \"cruel and \nunusual\" in the latter they are \"cruel, inhuman or degrading\". \n\n \n \n[158]  In Furman v. Georgia172 the US Supreme Court had to consider a case where the \n\ndetermination of whether the penalty for murder and rape should be death or another \npunishment was left by the State of Georgia to the discretion of the judge or of the \njury. In the course of his judgment173 Douglas J referred with approval to the \nfollowing comments in a journal article: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\"A penalty ... should be considered 'unusually' imposed if it is administered \narbitrarily or discriminatingly ... [t]he extreme rarity with which applicable death \npenalty provisions are put to use raises a strong inference of arbitrariness.\" \n\nHe further expressed the view174 that - \n\n\"[t]he high service rendered by the 'cruel and unusual' punishment clause of the \nEighth Amendment is to require legislatures to write penal laws that are evenhanded, \n\n                                                 \n     172408 US 238 (1972). \n\n     173Id. at 249. \n\n     174Id. at 256. \n\n \n \n\n98 \n\n\f \n \n \n[159]  On the issue of arbitrariness Brennan J observed in Furman175 that - \n \n\nnon-selective, and nonarbitrary ...\" \n\nACKERMANN J \n\n\"In determining whether a punishment comports with human dignity, we are aided \nalso by a second principle inherent in the [Cruel and Unusual Punishments] Clause - \nthat the State must not arbitrarily inflict a severe punishment.

Nor is the distinction credible \nin fact.\" \n\n[160]  Stewart J founded his judgment on the fact that the imposition of so extreme a penalty in \n\npursuance of the Georgia statute was inevitably arbitrary. After referring to the fact \nthat \"the petitioners are among a capriciously selected random handful upon whom \nthe sentence of death has in fact been imposed\" he concludes simply by holding that - \n\n \n\n \n\n\"the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments cannot tolerate the infliction of a sentence \nof death under legal systems that permit this unique penalty to be so wantonly and so \nfreakishly imposed\"177 \n\n                                                 \n\n     176Id. at 294. \n\n     177Id. at 309 - 310. \n\n \n \n\n100 \n\n\f \n \n[161]  In Callins v.

[T]he consistency and rationality promised in \nFurman are inversely related to the fairness owed the individual when considering a \nsentence of death.

Union of India 1978 SC 597 at 624: \n\n \n\n\"We must reiterate here what was pointed out by the majority in E.P.

In fact equality and \narbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic, while \nthe other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, \nit is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional \nlaw and is, therefore violative of Article 14.'\" \n\n \n[164]  I am mindful of the fact that it is virtually impossible (save in the case of rigidly \n\ncircumscribed mandatory sentences - which present other dangers) to avoid elements \nof arbitrariness in the imposition of any punishment.

Collins, supra, at 1132, Blackmun J, quoting from the opinion of Stewart, Powell and Stevens \nJJ in Woodson v. North Carolina 428 US 280 (1976) at 305, pointed out that because of the qualitative \ndifference of the death penalty, \"there is a corresponding difference in the need for reliability in the \ndetermination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.\" \n\n \n \n\n104 \n\n\fACKERMANN J \n\n \n \n[165]  In paragraphs [44] to [46] of his judgment the President has referred to the relevant statutory \nprovisions prescribing the tests to be applied for the imposition of the death sentence \nand the guidelines laid down for their application by the Appellate Division of the \nSupreme Court. In the end, whatever guidelines are employed, a process of weighing \nup has to take place between \"mitigating factors\" (if any) and \"aggravating factors\" \nand thereafter a value judgment made as to whether \"the sentence of death is the \nproper sentence.\" I am not suggesting that the statutory provisions could have been \nbetter formulated or that the Appellate Division guidelines could be improved upon. \nThe fact of the matter is that they leave such a wide latitude for differences of \nindividual assessment, evaluation and normative judgment, that they are inescapably \narbitrary to a marked degree. There must be many borderline cases where two courts, \nwith the identical accused and identical facts, would undoubtedly come to different \nconclusions.  I have no doubt that even on a court composed of members of the genus \nHercules184 and Athena there would in many cases be differences of opinion, \nincapable of rational elucidation, on whether to impose the death penalty in a \nparticular case, where its imposition was, as in the case of section 277(1) of the \nCriminal Procedure Act, dependant on the application of widely formulated criteria \nand the exercise of difficult value judgments. \n\n \n[166]  The conclusion which I reach is that the imposition of the death penalty is inevitably \n\narbitrary and unequal. Whatever the scope of the right to life in section 9 of the \nConstitution may be, it unquestionably encompasses the right not to be deliberately \nput to death by the state in a way which is arbitrary and unequal. I would therefore \nhold that section 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act is inconsistent with the \nsection 9 right to life. I would moreover also hold that it is inconsistent with section \n\n                                                 \n\n     184Prof. Dworkin's lawyer \"of superhuman skill, learning, patience and acumen\"; see Taking Rights Seriously \n(1978) 105. \n\n \n \n\n105 \n\n\f \n \n\nACKERMANN J \n\n11(2). Where the arbitrary and unequal infliction of punishment occurs at the level of \na punishment so unique as the death penalty, it strikes me as being cruel and \ninhuman. For one person to receive the death sentence, where a similarly placed \nperson does not, is, in my assessment of values, cruel to the person receiving it. To \nallow chance, in this way, to determine the life or death of a person, is to reduce the \nperson to a cypher in a sophisticated judicial lottery. This is to treat the sentenced \nperson as inhuman. When these considerations are taken in conjunction with those set \nforth by the President in his judgment, they render the death penalty a cruel, inhuman \nand degrading punishment. For the reasons expounded by the President in his \njudgment, and with which I fully agree, neither the infringement of section 9 nor of \nsection 11(2) by section 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act, can be saved by the \nprovisions of section 33(1) of the Constitution. Accordingly the provisions of section \n277(1)(a) must be held to be inconsistent with sections 9 and 11(2) of the \nConstitution. \n\n \n[167]  In paragraphs [132] to [134] of his judgment the President alludes to the provision in section \n33(1)(b) of the Constitution that a limitation \"shall not negate the essential content of \nthe right in question\" but, after referring to uncertainties concerning its meaning, \nfinds it unnecessary to resolve the issue in the present case. In paragraph [133] he \npostulates, however, a subjective and an objective approach to the problem. I do not \nnecessarily agree with his formulation of the objective approach. In my view it is \nunnecessary in the present case to say anything at all about the meaning to be \nattached to this provision. It is one which the framers of our Constitution borrowed in \npart from article 19(2) of the German Basic Law (\"Grundgesetz\") which provides that \n- \n\n\"In keinem Falle darf ein Grundrecht in seinem Wesensgehalt angetastet \nwerden\" \n(\"In no case may the essence of a basic right be encroached upon\"15) \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n     15From the official translation published by the Press and Information Office of the Federal Government, \nBonn (1994). \n\n \n \n\n106 \n\n\f \n \n\nThere are obvious differences in the wording of the qualification.

This is a pressing public \nconcern. However important it undoubtedly is to emphasise the constitutional \nimportance of individual rights, there is a danger that the other leg of the \nconstitutional state compact may not enjoy the recognition it deserves. I refer to the \nfact that in a constitutional state individuals agree (in principle at least) to abandon \ntheir right to self-help in the protection of their rights only because the state, in the \nconstitutional state compact, assumes the obligation to protect these rights. If the state \nfails to discharge this duty adequately, there is a danger that individuals might feel \njustified in using self-help to protect their rights. This is not a fanciful possibility in \nSouth Africa. \"The need for a strong deterrent to violent crime\" is underscored by the \nPresident in his judgment as is the duty of the state, through the criminal justice \nsystem, to ensure that offenders will be apprehended and convicted, for these steps \nare conditions precedent to punishment.17 \n\n \n[169]  Apart from deterring others, one of the goals of punishment is to prevent the convicted \nprisoner from committing crimes again. Both the preventative and reformative \ncomponents of punishment are directed towards this end, although reformation \nobviously has the further commendable aim of the betterment of the prisoner. Society \nas a whole is justifiably concerned that this aim of punishment should be achieved \nand society fears the possibility that the violent criminal, upon release from prison, \nwill once again harm society. Society is particularly concerned with the possibility of \nthis happening in the case of an unreformed recidivist murderer or rapist if the death \npenalty is abolished. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n     17Para. 117. \n\n \n \n\n109 \n\n\fACKERMANN J \n\n \n \n[170]  The President has rightly pointed out in his judgment that in considering the deterrent effect \nof the death sentence the evaluation is not to be conducted by contrasting the death \npenalty with no punishment at all but between the death sentence and \"severe \npunishment of a long term of imprisonment which, in an appropriate case, could be a \nsentence of life imprisonment\";18  I agree with this approach. With the abolition of \nthe death penalty society needs the firm assurance that the unreformed recidivist \nmurderer or rapist will not be released from prison, however long the sentence served \nby the prisoner may have been, if there is a reasonable possibility that the prisoner \nwill repeat the crime. Society needs to be assured that in such cases the state will see \nto it that such a recidivist will remain in prison permanently. \n\n \n[171]  I appreciate the concern of not wishing to anticipate the issue as to whether life \n\nimprisonment, however executed and administered, is constitutional or not. At the \nsame time I do not believe that the two issues can be kept in watertight separate \njuristic compartments. If the death penalty is to be abolished, as I believe it must, \nsociety is entitled to the assurance that the state will protect it from further harm from \nthe convicted unreformed recidivist killer or rapist. If there is an individual right not \nto be put to death by the criminal justice system there is a correlative obligation on \nthe state, through the criminal justice system, to protect society from once again \nbeing harmed by the unreformed recidivist killer or rapist. The right and the \nobligation are inseparably part of the same constitutional state compact. \n\n \n\n                                                \n \n\n     18Para. 123. \n\n \n \n\n110 \n\n\f \nACKERMANN J \n \n[172]  Article 102 of the German Basic Law declares that capital punishment is abolished. The \n\nGerman Federal Constitutional Court considered the constitutionality of life \nimprisonment in 197719. The provision in the criminal code which prescribes life \nimprisonment for murder was challenged on the basis that it conflicted with the \nprotection afforded to human dignity (art 1.1) and personal freedom (art 2.2) in the \nGerman Basic Law. The Court upheld the law on the basis that it was not shown that \nthe serving of a sentence of life imprisonment leads to irreparable physical or \npsychological damage to the prisoner's health. The Court did however find that the \nright to human dignity demands a humane execution of the sentence. This meant that \nthe existing law, which made provision for executive pardon, had to be replaced by a \nlaw laying down objective criteria for the release of prisoners serving life sentences. \nIn the course of its judgment, the Court made clear that there is nothing \nconstitutionally objectionable to executing a life sentence in full in cases where the \nprisoner does not meet the criteria. At page 242 of the judgment the Court said: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\"Die Menschenw\u00fcrde wird auch dann nicht verletzt, wenn der Vollzug der Strafe \nwegen fortdauernder Gef\u00e4hrlichkeit des Gefangenen notwendig ist und sich aus \ndiesem Grunde eine Begnadigung verbietet. Es ist der staatlichen Gemeinschaft nicht \nverwehrt, sich gegen einen gemeingef\u00e4hrlichen Straft\u00e4ter durch Freiheitsentzug zu \nsichern.\" \n\n(\"Human dignity is not infringed when the execution of the sentence remains \nnecessary due to the continuing danger posed by the prisoner and clemency is for this \nreason precluded. The state is not prevented from protecting the community from \ndangerous criminals by keeping them incarcerated\".) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n[173]  DIDCOTT J:  I agree with Chaskalson P that our new Constitution (Act 200 of 1993) \n                                                 \n\n     1945 BVerfGE 187. \n\n \n \n\n111 \n\n\f \n \n\noutlaws capital punishment in South Africa for the crimes covered by his judgment,  \nand I concur in the order giving effect to that conclusion which he proposes to make. \n\nDIDCOTT J \n\n \n[174]  My grounds for believing the death penalty to be unconstitutional for the crimes in question \n\nare these. Capital punishment violates the right to life of every person that is \nprotected by section 9 of the Constitution and contravenes the prohibition pronounced \nin section 11(2) against cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, both of which bind \nthe state and its organs in terms of section 7(1).  The provisions of the Criminal \nProcedure Act ( 51 of 1977) that sanction sentences of death for such crimes are not \nsaved from nullification in their consequent clash with sections 9 and 11 (2).  For \nthey fail to satisfy the conditions which paragraph (a) of section 33(1) prescribes for \ntheir survival as exceptions to the general rule, the conditions requiring that they must \nbe reasonable in the first place and, in a society of the sort described there, justifiable \nin the second.  Nor do they pass the further test of necessity set by paragraph (aa) for \nany permissible invasion of section 11(2). \n\n \n[175]  Perhaps the essential content of the right to life is negated in addition, an effect not \n\ncountenanced by paragraph (b) of section 33(1) which subjects the legitimacy of any \nencroachment on the right to the extra requirement that no such result may ever \nensue.  That point may be put aside, however, once the requirements of paragraphs \n(a) and (aa) are not met.  Negating the essential content of a constitutional right is a \nconcept less simple and clear than it may appear at first to be. Any definitive ruling \non its import that was made now would have a profound bearing on other issues \nlikely to confront us in the future, with implications for them which are difficult to \nforesee at so early a stage in the development of our jurisprudence.  It is better, I \ntherefore feel, not to go into the question on this occasion, but to leave that open for \nconsideration and decision on a different one when it has to be answered. \n\n \n[176]   Nor, for much the same reasons, do I think it wise to venture at present a comprehensive and \nexact definition of what is encompassed by the constitutional right to life. It suffices \nfor the purposes of this case to say that the proclamation of the right and the respect \n\n \n \n\n112 \n\n\f \n \n\nDIDCOTT J \n\nfor it demanded from the state must surely entitle one, at the very least, not to be put \nto death by the state deliberately, systematically and as an act of policy that denies in \nprinciple the value of the victim's life.  Those are  hardly features of deaths  which the \nstate may happen to cause in the course of waging defensive warfare, quelling an \ninsurrection or rescuing hostages, to cite some situations debated before us in which a \nconstitutional protection of life was said to be inconceivable.  Such hallmarks do, \nhowever, characterise every execution by the state of a criminal. \n\n \n[177]  Whether execution ranks also as a cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment is a question \n\nthat lends itself to no precise measurement.  It calls for a value judgment in an area \nwhere personal opinions are prone to differ, a value judgment that can easily become \nentangled with or be influenced by one's own moral attitude and feelings.  \nJudgments of that order must often be made by courts of law, however, whose \ntraining and experience warns them against the trap of undue subjectivity.  Such a \njudgment is now required from us, at all events, and would have been inescapable \nwhichever way the question was answered.  Nor do we lack guidance on it.  A \nprovision of the Zimbabwean Constitution which banned inhuman or degrading \npunishment was considered by their Supreme Court in Catholic Commission for \nJustice and Peace in Zimbabwe v Attorney-General, Zimbabwe, and Others 1993(4) \nSA 239 (ZSC).  Gubbay CJ had this to say about it (at 247 I - 248 B): \n\n\"It is a provision that embodies broad and idealistic notions of dignity, humanity \nand decency.  It guarantees that punishment.....of the individual be exercised within \nthe ambit of civilised standards.  Any punishment.....incompatible with the evolving \nstandards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, or which involve \nthe infliction of unnecessary suffering, is repulsive.  What might not have been \nregarded as inhuman decades ago may be revolting to the new sensitivities which \nemerge as civilisation advances\". \n\n \nThe same goes, I firmly believe, for our section 11(2).  Gubbay CJ continued thus (at \n248 B-C): \n\n113 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n \n\nDIDCOTT J \n\n\"(A)n application of this approach to whether a form of ... punishment ... is inhuman \nor degrading is dependent upon the exercise of a value judgment ...; one that must \nnot only take account of the emerging consensus of values in the civilised \ninternational community (of which this country is a part) ..., but of contemporary \nnorms operative in Zimbabwe and the sensitivities of its people\". \n\nI take that view here too, where such norms and sensitivities are demonstrated, \nabove all else, by the altruistic and humanitarian philosophy which animates the \nConstitution enjoyed by us nowadays. \n\n \n \n[178]  Capital punishment was discussed at length in Furman v State of Georgia(1972) 408 US \n\n238, a case handled by the Supreme Court of the United States of America in which \na comparably liberal philosophy was expounded by a number of the judges hearing \nit.  Stewart J described that sentence (at 306) as - \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u201c.....unique ...in its absolute renunciation of all that is embodied in our \nconcept of humanity.\u201d \n\nBrennan J agreed, declaring in the same case (at 290 and 291) that: \n\n\u201cDeath is truly an awesome punishment.  The calculated killing of a human being \nby the state involves, by its very nature, a denial of the executed person\u2019s humanity. \n The contrast with the plight of a person punished by imprisonment is evident....A \nprisoner remains a member of the human family...In comparison to all other \npunishments...the deliberate extinguishment of human life by the state is uniquely \ndegrading to human dignity\u201d. \n\nThe distinctive features of the penalty were emphasised by Brennan J elsewhere in \nhis judgment, when he wrote (at 287 and 288) that: \n\n\u201cDeath is today an unusually severe punishment, unusual in its pain, in its finality, \nand in its enormity. No other existing punishment is comparable to death in terms of \nphysical and mental suffering...  Since the discontinuance of flogging as a \nconstitutionally permissible punishment..., death remains the only punishment that \nmay involve the conscious infliction of physical pain.  In addition, we know that \n\n114 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nDIDCOTT J \n\nmental pain is an inseparable part of our practice of punishing criminals by death, \nfor the prospect of pending execution exacts a frightful toll during the inevitable \nlong wait between the imposition of sentence and the actual infliction of death... \nThe unusual severity of death is manifested most clearly in its finality and enormity. \n Death, in these respects, is in a class by itself.\u201d \n\nIn a Californian case, the one of The People v Anderson (1972) 493 P 2d 880, \nWright CJ observed (at 894) that: \n\n \n\n\u201cThe cruelty of capital punishment lies not only in the execution itself and the pain \nincident thereto, but also in the dehumanising effects of the lengthy imprisonment \nprior to execution during which the judicial and administrative procedures essential \nto due process of law are carried out. Penologists and medical experts agree that the \nprocess of carrying out a verdict of death is often so degrading and brutalising to the \nhuman spirit as to constitute psychological torture.\u201d \n\nLiacos J elaborated on that aspect of the matter in the judgment which he delivered \nwhen District Attorney for the Suffolk District v Watson and Others (1980) 381 Mass \n648  \n\nwas decided in Massachusetts.  The passages that I shall quote (at 678 - 9, 681 and \n683) are vivid.  They went thus: \n\n\u201cThe ordeals of the condemned are inherent and inevitable in any system that \ninforms the condemned person of his sentence and provides for a gap between \nsentence and execution.  Whatever one believes about the cruelty of the death \npenalty itself, this violence done the prisoner\u2019s mind must afflict the conscience of \nenlightened government and give the civilised heart no rest...  The condemned must \nconfront this primal terror directly, and in the most demeaning circumstances.  A \ncondemned man knows, subject to the possibility of successful appeal or \ncommutation, the time and manner of his death.  His thoughts about death must \nnecessarily be focussed more precisely than other people\u2019s.  He must wait for a \nspecific death, not merely expect death in the abstract.  Apart from cases of suicide \nor terminal illness, this certainty is unique to those who are sentenced to death.  The \nstate puts the question of death to the condemned person, and he must grapple with \nit without the consolation that he will die naturally or with his humanity intact.  A \ncondemned person experiences an extreme form of debasement....  The death \nsentence itself is a declaration that society deems the prisoner a nullity, less than \n\n115 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n\nDIDCOTT J \nhuman and unworthy to live.  But that negation of his personality carries through the \nentire period between sentence and execution.\u201d \n\nA similar account was furnished by Gubbay CJ in the Catholic Commission case \nwhen he said (at 268 E-H): \n\n\u201cFrom the moment he enters the condemned cell, the prisoner is enmeshed in a \ndehumanising environment of near hopelessness.  He is in a place where the sole \nobject is to preserve his life so that he may be executed.  The condemned prisoner is \n\u2018the living dead\u2019.....  He is kept only with other death sentence prisoners - with those \nwhose appeals have been dismissed and who await death or reprieve; or those \nwhose appeals are still to be heard or are pending judgment.  While the right to an \nappeal may raise the prospect of being allowed to live, the intensity of the trauma is \nmuch increased by knowledge of its dismissal.  The hope of a reprieve is all that is \nleft.  Throughout all this time the condemned prisoner constantly broods over his \nfate.  The horrifying spectre of being hanged by the neck and the apprehension of \nbeing made to suffer a painful....death is ....never far from mind.\u201d \n\n[179]   The Constitutions of California and Massachusetts forbade cruel punishments.  Sentences of \ndeath were held in each state to be contraventions of the prohibition which could not \nstand.  The decision reached in the case of the District Attorney for Suffolk was \nannounced by Hennessey CJ, who said (at 664 and 665): \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u201c(T)he death penalty is unacceptable under contemporary standards of decency in its \nunique and inherent capacity to inflict pain.  The mental agony is, simply and \nbeyond question, a horror....  We conclude..... that the death penalty, with its full \npanoply of concomitant physical and mental tortures, is impermissibly cruel.....when \njudged by contemporary standards of decency.\u201d \n\nExecutions were not outlawed altogether, on the other hand, in either Furman v State \nof Georgia or the case of the Catholic Commission, despite the castigation that they \nthen underwent.  The reason lay in the special provisions of the governing charters, \nthe Constitutions of the United States and Zimbabwe, each of which impliedly \nauthorised the punishment, or appeared at least to do so, by protecting the right to \nlife in terms that specifically excluded deaths thus caused.  So, while executions \ncould be and were banned in the particular circumstances of the two cases, \ninsufficient room was visible for the total embargo which Brennan J and Gubbay CJ \nwould no doubt have preferred to impose on them.  No such obstacle was presented \nby the Constitution of Massachusetts or found to be raised at that time by the \nCalifornian one.  None of this detracts, however, from my purpose in repeating the \n\n116 \n\n\f \n \n\nDIDCOTT J \n\nharrowing descriptions given on all four occasions of the ordeal suffered by \ncriminals awaiting and experiencing execution.  I am unaware of any criticism ever \nlevelled at those descriptions, which were not disputed before us when reliance was \nplaced on them in argument, and I have no reason to believe that they may have been \ninaccurate or exaggerated in any material respect.  They suffice on the whole to \nconvince me that every sentence of death must be stamped, for the purposes of \nsection 11(2), as an intrinsically cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. \n\n \n[180]  I pass to the question whether capital punishment is nevertheless allowed by section 33(1) \nfor the crimes that concern us now.  I am not sure that a sentence with a sequel of \nsuch cruelty, inhumanity and degradation can ever be rightly regarded in a civilised \nsociety as a reasonable or justifiable measure, let alone a necessary one.  But I shall \nassume that the penalty is not innately incapable of meeting those requirements. \n\n \n[181]  The most familiar argument advanced in support of capital punishment, and the main \n\ncontention we have to consider under the heading of its suggested permissibility, is \nthat executions operate as a unique deterrent against the future commission of the \ncrimes visited with them.  That proposition, if sound indeed, deserves to be taken \nseriously.  It then provides the strongest reason, in cases of murder at all events, for \nrating the sentence of death as an expedient which, though regrettable, passes \nconstitutional muster.  For section 9 protects likewise the lives of the innocent, the \nlives of potential victims.  And that is a factor which must enter the reckoning, \nespecially at present when the crimes of violence perpetrated here have become so \nprevalent and reached a level so appalling that acute anxiety is felt everywhere about \nthe danger to life lurking around the corner.  Such a time was said to be hardly \npropitious for, such a state of affairs to be scarcely conducive to, any relaxation in \nthe rigour of the law.  We dared not exacerbate the danger, we were warned, by \nreducing the force of deterrence in the combat with it.  I agree that the nation cannot \nafford our doing so, and we would not wish it anyhow.  Sight must never be lost, \nhowever, of this.  The question is not whether capital punishment has a deterrent \neffect, but whether its deterrent effect happens to be significantly greater than that of \n\n117 \n\n \n \n\n\f \n \n\nthe alternative sentence available, a suitably severe sentence of imprisonment which \nnot only gets passed but may also be expected to run its course. \n\n \n\nDIDCOTT J \n\n[182]  The debate surrounding that question, an old one both here and elsewhere, has often been \nmarked by the production of statistical evidence tendered to show that the death penalty \neither does not or does serve a uniquely deterrent purpose, as the case may be.  The rate \nof capital crimes committed in a state performing executions is compared with that of \nthe selfsame crimes experienced contemporaneously in some place or another where \nnone occurs.  The records of countries that executed convicts formerly, but have ceased \ndoing so, are also examined.  Comparisons are then drawn between the rates of those \ncrimes found there before the punishment was abandoned and the ones encountered \nafterwards.  Such statistics, when analysed, have always turned out to be inconclusive in \nthe end.  The pictures that they purport to present differ in the first place.  The clarity of \nthe sketching is impaired, in the second, by all sorts of variable factors for which no \nallowance is or can be made.  One thinks, for instance, of differences and fluctuations in \nmoral codes and values, in the efficiency and success of police forces in preventing and \ninvestigating crimes, in the climate for the collaboration and assistance that they need to \nobtain  from  the  public  and  the  extent  of  it  which  they  manage  to  gain,  in  the \norganisation and skills of criminal conspirators and, above all perhaps, in the social and \neconomic conditions that have so profound a bearing everywhere on the incidence of \ncrimes.  It therefore did not surprise me to hear that no great store was set in argument \nby figures of that kind.  Others were drawn to our attention, which related to South \nAfrica alone.  They recorded the number of alleged murders that were reported here \nduring  every  year  from  1988  until  1993,  inclusive  of  both.    A  globular  increase \nemerged, the rate of which over the whole period of six years amounted approximately \nto 35% and accordingly to an annual average of almost 6%, calculated for convenience \nby  means  of  a  straight  division  that  inflates  the  rate  slightly,  to  be  sure,  since  it \ndisregards the effect on the percentage of the change from year to year in the figure on \nwhich it ought actually to be based.  Interesting to notice, however, is this.  The number \nof alleged murders rose by a mere 1% or thereabouts during 1993, in contrast with the \n\n \n \n\n118 \n\n\f \n \n\nDIDCOTT J \n\naverage rate of 6% postulated, and by 9% during the time from the beginning of 1992 \nuntil the end of 1993, which remained lower than the corresponding average of 12% for \nthat period of two years.  The significance of the arithmetic lies in the fact that the \nmoratorium on executions was announced, formally and firmly, in March 1992.  What \nthe exercise appears to illustrate, if statistics prove anything in such an area, is the \nirrelevance  of  the  announcement  to  the  rate of murders alleged, which had grown \nsteadily  while  executions  were  carried  out  and  was  not  accelerated  by  the  halt  in \nhangings.  The results of my analysis, for what they are worth, may be added to the \ncogent and stronger reasons which Chaskalson P has supplied in paragraphs [119] and \n[120] for rejecting the contention addressed to us that the moratorium had contributed \nmaterially to the increase. \n\n \n[183]  Without empirical proof of the extent to which capital punishment worked as a deterrent, \nneither side could present any argument on the point better than the appeal to common \nsense that tends to be lodged whenever the debate is conducted.  That the extreme \npenalty must inevitably be more terrifying than anything else was said, on the one hand, \nto speak for itself.  It spoke superficially, we were told on the other, and unrealistically \ntoo.  What stood to reason was this instead.  A very large proportion of murderers were \nin no mood or state of mind at the time to contemplate or care about the consequences \nof their killings which they might personally suffer.  Those rational enough to take \naccount of them gambled by and large on their escape from detection and arrest, where \nthe  odds  in  their  favour  were  often  rather  high.    The  prospect  of  conviction  and \npunishment  was  much  less  immediate  and  seldom  entered  their  thinking.    It  was \nfanciful, should that happen on relatively rare occasions, to imagine their being daunted \nby  the  possibility  of  a  journey  to  the  gallows,  a  journey  taken  by  only  a  small \npercentage of convicted murderers even at the height of executions in this country, but \nnot by the probability of incarceration  in a jail for many years and perhaps for the rest \nof their lives.  The second school of thought is the one which gets to grips with the \nrealities of the matter, in my opinion, appraising them with a lot more plausibility and \npersuasiveness than any that attaches to the stark proposition of the first school. \n\n \n \n \n\n119 \n\n\fDIDCOTT J \n\n \n \n[184]  It is unnecessary, however, to go so far. The protagonists of capital punishment bear the burden \nof satisfying us that it is permissible under section 33(1).  To the extent that their case \ndepends upon the uniquely deterrent effect attributed to it, they must therefore convince \nus that it indeed serves such a purpose.  Nothing less is expected from them in any event \nwhen human lives are at stake,  lives which may not continue to be destroyed on the \nmere possibility that some good will come of it.  In that task they have failed and, as far \nas one can see, could never have succeeded. \n\n \n[185]  In his judgment Chaskalson P has discussed retribution as another goal of punishment, and the \narbitrariness and inequality contaminating our processes that culminate in executions.  \nHis treatment of the first subject will be found in paragraphs [129] to [131] and of the \nsecond one in paragraphs [48] to [54].  I share the view taken by him that retribution \nsmacks too much of vengeance to be accepted, either on its own or in combination with \nother aims, as a worthy purpose of punishment in the enlightened society to which we \nSouth Africans have now committed ourselves, and that the expression of moral outrage \nwhich is its further and more defensible object can be communicated effectively by \nsevere sentences of imprisonment.  The inequality of which he has written may be \ncurable in the long run, once it is not the result of the arbitrariness described by him.  \nThe same does not go, however, for the arbitrariness itself, a flaw in the edifice which \nAckermann J has examined as well in paragraphs [158] to [165].  The problem of that is \nquite as intractable here as it has proved to be in the United States of America, where \nthe courts have wrestled with it constantly and by no means to their satisfaction.  For \nsuch arbitrariness is largely inherent in the nature of the proceedings from start to finish. \n Similar trouble may be inescapable, to be sure, in cases that are not capital ones.  But in \nthose  producing  sentences  of  death  the  arbitrariness  is  intolerable  because  of  the \nirreversibility  of  the  punishment  once  that  gets  put  into  force  and  the  consequent \nirremediability of mistakes discovered afterwards, mistakes which do occur now and \nthen notwithstanding the myth to the contrary.  The defect then militates forcefully, I \nbelieve, against the reasonableness and justifiability of capital punishment. \n\n \n[186]  The conclusion to which I have thus come, echoing the one reached by Chaskalson P, is that the \n \n \n\n120 \n\n\f \n \n\nDIDCOTT J \n\ndeath penalty cannot survive our constitutional scrunity of it.  The line I have taken in \narriving there differs in some parts from that preferred by him, occasionally approaching \na topic from another angle and sometimes placing the emphasis elsewhere.  It has also \ncalled for less elaboration in the light of his meticulous research into a mountain of \nmaterial and his erudite exposition of the themes developed from that.  In general, \nhowever, I agree with his judgment, a profound and monumental work with which I feel \nproud to associate myself. \n\n \n[187]  I wish before ending this judgment to add my voice to that of Chaskalson P in dealing with a \ncouple of points raised in argument on which he has commented already but which I \nhave not yet mentioned.   \n\n[188]  Whether capital punishment ought to be abolished or retained amounted, so it was said, to a \nquestion of policy which Parliament should decide, representing as it did the citizens of \nthe country and expressing their general will.  The issue is also, however, a constitutional \none.  It has been put before us squarely and properly.  We cannot delegate to Parliament \nthe duty that we bear to determine it, or evade that duty otherwise, but must perform it \nourselves.  In doing so, we were counselled in the alternative, we had to pay great \nattention to public opinion, which was said to favour the retention of the death penalty.  \nWe have no means of ascertaining whether that is indeed so, but I shall assume it to be \nthe case.  One may also assume, with a fair measure of confidence, that most members of \nthe public who support capital punishment do so primarily in the belief that, owing to its \nuniquely  deterrent  force,  they  and  their  families  are  safer  with  than  without  its \nprotection.  The feeling is quite understandable, given its basis.  But it deserves no \nfurther  homage  if  the  premise  underlying  and  accounting  for  it  is  fallacious  or \nunfounded, as I consider that one to be.  To allow ourselves to be influenced unduly by \npublic  opinion  would,  in  any  event,  be  wrong.    Powell  J  disparaged  such  external \npressures on constitutional adjudication when he said in Furman v State of Georgia (at \n443): \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u201c(T)he weight of the evidence indicates that the public generally has not accepted either \nthe morality or the social merit of the views so passionately advocated by the articulate \nspokesmen for abolition.  But however one may assess (the) amorphous ebb and flow of \n\n121 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n\nDIDCOTT J \npublic opinion generally on this volatile issue, this type of enquiry lies at the periphery - \nnot the core - of the judicial process in constitutional cases.  The assessment of popular \nopinion is essentially a legislative, not a judicial, function.\u201d \n\nIn similar vein were these remarks passed by Jackson J on the earlier occasion of West \nVirginia State Board of Education v Barnette and Others (1942) 319 U5 624 (at 638): \n\n\u201cThe  very  purpose  of  a  bill  of  rights  was  to  withdraw  certain  subjects  from  the \nvicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities... and \nto establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.  One\u2019s right to life.... \nand other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome \nof no elections.\u201d \n\n \n[189]  The  other  point  was  not  so  much  a  contention  as  a  complaint,  one  registered  against  the \nsympathy with murderers, and the lack of any felt for the victims and their families, \nwhich some proponents of capital punishment have seen as the motivation behind every \nattack on it.  It is unnecessary, I hope, for this court to answer that canard.  In rebuttal of \nthe criticism, lest it be levelled at us all the same, one can do no better than to repeat the \nfollowing excerpts from the judgment which Wright CJ wrote in The People v Anderson \n(at 896 and 899): \n\n \n\n\u201cWe are fully aware that many condemned prisoners have committed crimes of the \nutmost  cruelty  and depravity and that such persons are not entitled to the slightest \nsympathy from society in the administration of justice or otherwise....  Our conclusion \nthat the death penalty may no longer be exacted in California.... is not grounded in \nsympathy for those who would commit crimes of violence, but in concern for the society \nthat diminishes itself whenever it takes the life of one of its members.  Lord Chancellor \nGardiner reminded the House of Lords, debating abolition of capital punishment in \nEngland: \u2018When we abolished the punishment for treason that you should be hanged, \nand then cut down while still alive, and then disembowelled while still alive, and then \nquartered, we did not abolish that punishment because we sympathised with traitors, but \nbecause we took the view that it was a punishment no longer consistent with our self-\nrespect\u2019.\u201d \n\n \n[190]  South Africa has experienced too much savagery.  The wanton killing must stop before it makes \na mockery of the civilised, humane and compassionate society to which the nation \naspires and has constitutionally pledged itself.  And the state must set the example by \ndemonstrating the priceless value it places on the lives of all its subjects, even the worst. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n122 \n\n\f \n \n\nKENTRIDGE AJ \n[191]  KENTRIDGE AJ:  I agree with the order proposed by Chaskalson P and with the reasons for it \ncontained in his judgment and in the judgment of Didcott J In view of the importance of \nthe issue and in deference to the forceful submissions of Mr von Lieres SC, the Attorney-\nGeneral of the Witwatersrand, I add some remarks of my own. \n\n \n[192]  Capital  punishment  is  an  issue  on  which  many  members  of  the  public  hold  strong  and \nconflicting views.  To many of them it may seem strange that so difficult and important a \npublic issue should be decided by the eleven appointed judges of this court.  It must be \nunderstood that we undertake this task not because we claim a superior wisdom for \nourselves but, as Chaskalson P has explained in his judgment, because the framers of the \nConstitution have imposed on us the inescapable duty of deciding whether the death \npenalty for murder is consistent with Chapter Three of the Constitution.  It should not be \noverlooked that a decision holding the death penalty to be constitutional would have \nbeen just as far-reaching an exercise of judicial power as the decision to strike it down. \n\n \n[193]  Some public commentators on the question before this court have supposed that any doubt as to \nthe  unconstitutionality  of  the  death  penalty  was  foreclosed  by  section  9  of  the \nConstitution, which proclaims in unqualified terms that every person shall have the right \nof life, read with section 33(1)(b), which provides that no statutory limitation on that or \nany other constitutional right shall \"negate the essential content of the right in question.\" \n The execution of a condemned prisoner, it is suggested, must negate entirely his right to \nlife and must therefore ipso facto be in conflict with the constitution.  For my part, I do \nnot believe that this supposedly simple solution bears examination.  Although the right to \nlife is stated in unqualified terms its full scope and implications remain to be worked out \nin future cases.  Certainly, as the President of the Court has pointed out, the right to life \nmust accommodate the right to kill in lawful self-defence of one's own life or the lives of \nothers, as well as the right of the State to defend itself against insurrection.  The right to \nlife may also be seen as entailing a duty on the State to protect the lives of its citizens by \nensuring, as far as it is able, that unlawful killing is visited with condign punishment.  \nThat punishment like any other, must fall within the limits imposed by section 11(2) of \nthe Constitution.  As to section 33(1)(b), I agree with Chaskalson P that our decision in \n\n \n \n\n123 \n\n\f \n \n\nKENTRIDGE AJ \n\nthis  case  can  be  reached  without  requiring  the  Court  to  give  an  authoritative \ninterpretation of that clause.  We did, however, hear argument on the clause and I should \nlike to state briefly why I do not think that it provides the short answer to the problem of \nthe constitutionality of the death penalty. \n\n \n[194]  The source of section 33(1)(b) is presumably the similar provision in the Constitution of the \nFederal Republic of Germany.  As far as I am aware the German Constitutional Court \nhas never given any definite interpretation to that clause.  Varying constructions of it \nhave been suggested by the authors cited by Chaskalson P in the footnotes to paragraphs \n108 and 132 of his Judgment;  see also the discussion by Rautenbach in 1991 TSAR 403. \n For present purposes it is sufficient to mention two possible interpretations of section \n33(1)(b).  The first is that it requires one to consider the effect of any State action on the \nindividual concerned - sometimes called the subjective approach.  On this basis the \ninfliction of the death penalty must conflict with section 33(1)(b) because in destroying \nlife it must negate the essence of the right to life.  I do not find this so-called subjective \ninterpretation convincing.   It cannot accommodate the many State measures which must \nbe necessary and justifiable in any society, such as long-term imprisonment for serious \ncrimes.   It is true that a prisoner, even one held under secure conditions, retains some \nresidual rights.  See Whittaker v Roos 1912 A.D. 92, 122-3, per Innes J.  But I find it \ndifficult to comprehend how, on any rational use of language, it could be denied that \nwhile he is in prison the essence of the prisoner's right to freedom (section 11), of his or \nher right to leave the Republic (section 20) or to pursue a livelihood anywhere in the \nnational territory (section 26) is not negated.  Many other examples could be given \nwhich in my view rule out the subjective approach of the sub-section. \n\n \n[195]  The other approach (sometimes, not altogether appropriately, called the objective approach) is to \n examine the law which is sought to be justified under section 33.  That section states \nthat rights entrenched in Chapter Three may be limited by laws of general application \nprovided that such limitation complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) of sub-\nsection 1 and provided further that it does not negate the essential content of the right in \nquestion.  What must pass scrutiny under section 33 is the limitation contained in the law \n\n \n \n\n124 \n\n\f \n \n\nKENTRIDGE AJ \n\nof general application.  This means in my opinion that it is the law itself which must pass \nthe test.  On this basis a law providing for imprisonment for defined criminal conduct, \ncannot be said to negate the essential content of the right to freedom, whatever the effect \non the individual prisoner serving a sentence under that law.  Similarly such a law would \nnot negate the essential content of the right of free movement.  Those are general rights \nentrenched in the Constitution, and a law which preserves those rights for most people at \nmost times does not negate the essential content of those rights.  An example of a law \nwhich might negate the essence of the right to freedom of movement would be a law \n(such as the Departure from the Republic Act, 1955) under which no person may leave \nthe  Republic  without  the  express  or  implied  consent  of  the  Government.    Another \npossible example could relate to the right of freedom of speech.  A law providing for \ngeneral censorship of all publications would on the face of it negate the essence of the \nright to freedom of speech.  On the other hand a law providing penalties for what is \ncolloquially referred to as \"hate speech\" would not, I think, negate the essence of that \nright.    (Whether  or  not  it  would  meet  the other criteria of section 33 is a different \nquestion.) \n\n \n[196]  It follows that in my opinion that the true issue for decision is whether or not the death penalty \nfor murder is a \"cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment\", although the entrenched right \nto life, like the right to dignity and to equality of treatment, does illuminate the issue.  As \nboth Chaskalson P and Didcott J have emphasised, capital punishment is qualitatively \nsomething  quite  apart  from  even  the  longest  term  of  imprisonment.    It  entails  the \ncalculated  destruction  of  a  human  life.    Inequalities  in  its  incidence  are  probably \nunavoidable.  In the infliction of capital punishment judicial and executive error can \nnever be wholly excluded nor, of course, repaired.  With regard to the uniquely cruel and \ninhuman nature of the death penalty I would refer to the ample citation of American \nauthority by Didcott J in paragraphs 6 and 7 of his Judgment and to the various decisions \nof international tribunals cited by Chaskalson P.  I would add to these the judgment of \nBlackmun J in Callins v Collins 114 S. Ct. 1127 (1994).  The statement of Stewart J in \nFurman v Georgia 408 US 238 at 306 cited by Scalia J in Harmelin v Michigan 501 US \n957 (1991), also deserves repetition: \n\n \n \n\n125 \n\n\f \n \n \n\n \n\nKENTRIDGE AJ \n\n\"The penalty of death differs from all other forms of criminal punishment, not \nin degree but in kind.  It is unique in its total irrevocability.  It is unique in its \nrejection of rehabilitation of the convict as a basic purpose of criminal justice.  \nAnd it is unique, finally, in its absolute renunciation of all that is embodied in \nour concept of humanity.\" \n\nThe \"death row\" phenomenon as a factor in the cruelty of capital punishment has been \neloquently described by Lord Griffiths in Pratt v Johnson [1994] 2 AC 1 and by Gubbay \nCJ in Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe v Attorney General \nZimbabwe 1994 (4) SA 329.  Those were cases of inordinately extended delay in the \ncarrying out of the death sentence, but the mental agony of the criminal, in its alternation \nof fear, hope and despair must be present even when the time between sentence and \nexecution is measured in months or weeks rather than years. \n\n \n[197]  It may be said that if the punishment is cruel so was the act of the murderer.  That cannot and \nshould  not  be  denied.    In  the  present  case  the  Appellants  committed  murders  of \nhorrifying callousness motivated by nothing but greed.  In some of the cases summarised \nin the Attorney-General's written submissions, all of them cases in which the Appellate \nDivision had confirmed the sentence of death, the accused had, if that were possible, \ncommitted  even  more  revolting  acts  of  cruelty  against  their  victims.    I  agree  with \nChaskalson P that proportionality is an ingredient to be taken into account in deciding \nwhether a penalty is cruel, inhuman or degrading.  But that does not mean that the State \nshould respond to the murderer's cruelty with a deliberate and matching cruelty of its \nown.  As Simon Jenkins said in a recent article on the death penalty in \"The Times\" \n(London), that would imply that punishment must not merely fit the crime, but repeat the \ncrime. \n\n \n[198]  Section 35 of the Constitution requires us to \"promote the values which underlie an open and \ndemocratic society based on freedom and equality.\"  We are thus entitled and obliged to \nconsider  the  practices  of  such  societies.    That  exercise  shows  us  that  most  of  the \ncountries which we would naturally include in that category have abolished capital \npunishment as a penalty for murder, either by legislation or by disuse.  These countries \n\n \n \n\n126 \n\n\f \n \n\nKENTRIDGE AJ \n\ninclude the neighbouring States of Namibia, Angola and Mozambique.  The principal \nexceptions are the great democracies of India and the United States.  In each of those \ncountries  the  written  constitution  expressly  contemplates  the  legitimacy,  subject  to \nsafeguards, of the death penalty.  Thus the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States begins with the words, \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or \notherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury...\"  \nThere are similar express indications of the acceptability of the death sentence in Article \n21 of the Constitution of India.  It is therefore understandable that the Supreme Courts of \nthose two countries have found themselves unable to hold that the death penalty is per se \nunconstitutional.  Nonetheless, in our attempt to identify objectively the values of an \nopen and democratic society what I find impressive is that individual judges of great \ndistinction such as Brennan J in the United States and Bhagwati J in India have held, \nnotwithstanding those constitutional provisions, that the death penalty is impermissible \nwhen measured against the standards of humanity and decency which have evolved since \nthe date of their respective constitutions.  Similarly, courts to which considerable respect \nis due, such as the Supreme Court of California in People v Anderson 493 P.2d 880 \n(1972) and the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in District Attorney for the \nSuffolk District v Watson 381 Mass 648 (1980) have held the death penalty to be a \"cruel \nand  inhuman  punishment\"  and  therefore  in  conflict  with  their  respective  State \nconstitutions.  In the California case that decision was arrived at notwithstanding clauses \nin  the  State  Constitution  which,  like  the  United States Constitution, recognised the \nexistence of capital punishment.  (See Anderson's case at 886-7). \n\n \n[199]  The reference to \"evolving standards of decency\" is taken from the judgment of Warren CJ in \nTrop v Dulles 356 US 86 at 101 (1958) where, speaking for the Court, he adopted as the \nmeasure of permissible punishment under the Eighth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution \"the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing \nsociety.\"  Commenting on this dictum in Thomson v Oklahoma 487 US 815 (1988) \nScalia J (dissenting) said at 865: \n\n \n \n \n\n\"Of course, the risk of assessing evolving standards is that it is all too easy to \nbelieve that evolution has culminated in one's own views.\" \n\n127 \n\n\f \n \n\nKENTRIDGE AJ \n\nThis is a pertinent warning which I have, I hope, kept in mind.  I believe, nonetheless, \nthat there is ample objective evidence that evolving standards of civilisation demonstrate \nthe unacceptability of the death penalty in countries which are or aspire to be free and \ndemocratic societies.  Most democratic countries have abandoned the death penalty for \nmurder.  Even in countries which have the death penalty on the statute books there is a \ndecline in its use.  Although one cannot say that the death penalty is as yet contrary to \ninternational law, Chaskalson P has demonstrated that that is the direction in which \ninternational law is developing.  I shall come later to the question of public opinion and \nthe guidance to be obtained from it, but what is clear to my mind is that in general in \ncivilised democratic societies the imposition of the death penalty has been found to be \nunacceptably cruel, inhuman and degrading, not only to those subjected to it but also to \nthe society which inflicts it.  Simon Jenkins, in the article which I have already quoted, \nsays that the State is (or should be) \"institutionalised civilisation.\"  I would agree, and \nadd  that  this  is  especially  true  of  the  State  created  by  our  new  Constitution.    The \ndeliberate execution of a human, however depraved and criminal his conduct, must \ndegrade the new society which is coming into being. \n\n \n[200]  In the course of argument before us much was said about public opinion on the death penalty in \nSouth Africa.  Both Chaskalson P and Didcott J have shown that public opinion, even if \nexpressed in acts of Parliament, cannot be decisive.  If we were simply to defer to public \nopinion we would be abdicating from our constitutional function.  Yet, were public \nopinion on the question clear it could not be entirely ignored.  The accepted mores of \none's own society must have some relevance to the assessment whether a punishment is \nimpermissibly cruel and inhuman.  In Furman v Georgia 408 US 238 (1972) Brennan J \nat 277 said that one of the principles inherent in the constitutional prohibition of cruel \nand unusual punishments was that \"a severe punishment must not be unacceptable to \ncontemporary society.\"  Much earlier, in  Weems v United States 217 US 349, 378 (1910) \nthe United States Supreme Court had held that that provision of the Constitution was \n\"not fastened to the obsolete\", but might \"acquire meaning as public opinion becomes \nenlightened by a human justice.\"  I would, with all respect, suggest that the principle \npropounded by Brennan J may give too much weight to prevailing opinion - an opinion \n\n \n \n\n128 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nKENTRIDGE AJ \n\nwhich may swing with public moods and varying public concerns.  But in any event, \nwhether or not a punishment is acceptable to contemporary society is not to be judged by \nthe results of informal public opinion polls, still less by letters to the press.  In People v \nAnderson (supra) Wright CJ speaking for the Supreme Court of California said at 893-4: \n\n\"Public acceptance of capital punishment is a relevant but not controlling factor \nin assessing whether it is consonant with contemporary standards of decency.  \nBut public acceptance cannot be measured by the existence of death penalty \nstatutes or by the fact that some juries impose death on criminal defendants.  \nNor are public opinion polls about a process which is far removed from the \nexperience  of  those  responding  helpful  in  determining  whether  capital \npunishment would be acceptable to an informed public were it even-handedly \napplied  to  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  persons  potentially  subject  to \nexecution.\" \n\nIn Gregg v Georgia 428 US 153 (1976) a judgment given four years after Furman v \nGeorgia, supra, Stewart J at 179-180 found that developments during that period had \nshown  that  \"a  large  proportion  of  American  society  continues  to  regard  it  (capital \npunishment) as an appropriate and necessary criminal sanction.\"  The principal evidence \non which Stewart J based this finding was that since the Furman case the legislatures of \n35 of the United States had enacted new death penalty statutes.  Further, the Congress of \nthe United States had enacted a statute providing the death penalty for aircraft piracy.  In \naddition, he referred to an official State-wide referendum in the State of California \nadopting a constitutional amendment that authorised capital punishment. \n\n \n[201]  Needless to say, there was no similar evidence before us. Public opinion has not expressed itself \nin a referendum, nor in any recent legislation.  Certainly, there is no evidence of a \ngeneral social acceptance of the death penalty for murderers such as might conceivably \nhave influenced our conclusions.  On the contrary, developments in South Africa point in \nthe opposite direction.  It is to be noted that even at the time, during the previous decade, \nwhen South Africa had the unenviable reputation for carrying out more executions than \nany other country in the western world, only a proportion of those convicted of murder \nwere sentenced to death, and of those many were reprieved.  The amendment to the \nCriminal  Procedure  Act  introduced  by  Act No 107 of 1990 drastically reduced the \nnumber  of  convicted  murderers  sentenced  to  death.    The  subsequent  developments \ndescribed by Chaskalson P including the official executive moratorium on the death \n\n \n \n\n129 \n\n\f \n \n\nKENTRIDGE AJ \n\npenalty announced in March 1992, while not evidence of general opinion, do cast serious \ndoubt  on  the  acceptability  of  capital  punishment  in  South  Africa.    In  fact,  we  are \ninformed, since 1989 there has been no judicial execution in South Africa.  Thus there \nhas been in this country no indication whatsoever of what Stewart J in Gregg's case \nreferred  to  as  \"society's  endorsement  of  the  death  penalty  for  murder.\"    In  the \nConstitution  itself  such  endorsement  is  markedly  absent.    Consequently,  in  all  the \ncircumstances, the appeal to public opinion could not affect our decision. \n\n \n[202]  There  is  little  I  wish  to  add  to  what  has been  said  by  other  members  of  the  Court  on  the \napplication of section 33.  On the question whether a death penalty can be justified by its \ndeterrent effect the statistical and other evidence is inconclusive, as it was bound to be.  \nAs the analysis of Chaskalson P shows the statistical evidence comes nowhere near \nestablishing that the death penalty is an effective deterrent against murder.  Nor on the \nother hand can it be shown that it is not a deterrent.  As Mr von Lieres pointed out, only \nthose who were not deterred enter the statistics;  the number who were deterred cannot \nbe known.  In Burns' well-known lines, \"What's done we often may compute/But know \nnot what's resisted.\"  The most impressive argument of Mr von Lieres on this aspect of \nthe case was that, statistics aside, the awfulness of the death penalty must in its nature \ndeter some would-be murderers.  In the face of the appalling murder rates in this country, \nhe said, we cannot afford to relinquish any possible weapon in the fight against violent \ncrime.  That is a powerful argument but, given the cruelty and inhumanity of the death \npenalty, it is an argument which cannot in the end prevail.  It relies essentially on the \nmere  possibility  that  the  death  sentence  may  deter  some  murderers.    That  is  not  a \nsufficient justification for the continued existence of such an extreme punishment. \n\n[203]  I have little to add, too, to what Chaskalson P has said on the element of retribution as an \nelement in punishment.  The Attorney-General's argument was that the criminal law \nincluding the modes of punishment must adequately reflect the moral outrage felt by \nsociety when a vicious and cold-blooded murder is committed.  This too I regard as an \nargument of weight.  One can understand in particular the reaction of the families of \nvictims of murderers and the feeling that the culprits \"deserve to die\".  But the choice, as \nChaskalson P has pointed out, is not between death penalty on the one hand and the \n\n \n \n\n130 \n\n\f \n \n\nKENTRIDGE AJ \n\ncondonation of the murderer's act on the other.  The choice is between the death penalty \nand  a  long  term  of  imprisonment  which  might  in  appropriate  cases  include  life \nimprisonment in the fullest sense of the term.  As a civilised society it is not open to us, \nin my opinion, to express our moral outrage by executing even the worst of murderers \nany more than we could do so by the public hangings or mutilations of a bygone time. \n\n \n[204]  In conclusion I would endorse what Didcott J has cogently stated;  the striking down of the \ndeath penalty entails no sympathy whatsoever for the murderer, nor any condonation of \nhis crime.  What our decision does entail is a recognition that even the worst and most \nvicious criminals are not excluded from the protections of the Constitution.  In 1910 Mr \nWinston Churchill speaking in the House of Commons said this: \n\n \n\n\"The mood and temper of the public in regard to the treatment of crime and \ncriminals is one of the most unfailing tests of the civilisation of any country.  A \ncalm dispassionate recognition of the rights of the accused, and even of the \nconvicted criminal, against the State - a constant heart-searching by all charged \nwith the duty of punishment - a desire and eagerness to rehabilitate in the \nworld  of  industry  those  who  have  paid  their  due  in  the  hard  coinage  of \npunishment:  tireless efforts towards discovery of curative and regenerative \nprocesses:  unfailing faith that there is a treasure, if you can only find it, in the \nheart of every man.  These are the symbols, which, in the treatment of crime \nand criminal, mark and measure the stored-up strength of a nation, and are sign \nand proof of the living virtue in it.\" \n\n \n \n[205]  KRIEGLER J:  I agree with the conclusions reached by Chaskalson P, endorse the bulk of his \nreasoning and concur in the order he has formulated.  There are just two points that I \nwish to add though:  the first by way of additional emphasis and the second to indicate a \nsomewhat different line of reasoning. \n\n \n[206]  The basic issue, as Chaskalson P points out in the opening and concluding paragraphs of the \nmain judgment, is whether the Constitution1 has outlawed capital punishment in South \nAfrica.2  The issue is not whether I favour the retention or the abolition of the death \n\n                                                 \n     1Constitution of The Republic of South Africa, Act No. 200 of 1993, as amended. \n\n     2As sanctioned by section 277(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977, as amended and the corresponding \n\n131 \n\n \n \n\n\f \n \n\nKRIEGLER J \npenalty,  nor  whether  this  Court,  Parliament  or  even  overwhelming  public  opinion \nsupports the one or the other view. The question is what the Constitution says about it. \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                        \nprovisions of the former Transkei, Bophuthatswana and Venda. \n\n \n \n\n132 \n\n\fKRIEGLER J \n\n \n \n[207]  In  answering  that  question  the  methods  to  be  used  are  essentially  legal,  not  moral  or \nphilosophical.  To be true the judicial process cannot operate in an ethical vacuum. After \nall, concepts like \"good faith\", \"unconscionable\" or \"reasonable\" import value judgments \ninto the daily grind of courts of law.  And it would be foolish to deny that the judicial \nprocess, especially in the field of constitutional adjudication, calls for value judgments in \nwhich extra-legal considerations may loom large.  Nevertheless, the starting point, the \nframework and the outcome of the exercise must be legal.  The foundation of our state \nand all its organs, the rules which govern their interaction and the entrenchment of the \nrights of its people are to be found in an Act of Parliament, albeit a unique one.3  That \nAct entrusts the enforcement of its provisions to courts of law.4  The \"court of final \ninstance over all matters relating to the interpretation, protection and enforcement\" of \nthose provisions is this Court,5 appointment to which is reserved for lawyers.6  The \n\n                                                 \n\n     3Section 4 of the Constitution describes it as \"the supreme law of the Republic ... [which] shall bind all \nlegislative, executive and judicial organs of state at all levels of government.\"  Section 7 makes Chapter 3, \ncontaining fundamental rights, binding on \"all legislative and executive organs of state at all levels of \ngovernment\" and provides that it \"shall apply to all law in force and all administrative decisions taken and acts \nperformed during the period of operation of this Constitution.\" \n\n     4See Chapter 7 of the Constitution. \n\n     5Section 98(2) of the Constitution. \n\n     6See section 99(2)(c) of the Constitution which requires on appointee to be a person who \"(i) is a judge of the \nSupreme Court or is qualified to be admitted as an advocate or attorney and has, for a cumulative period of at \nleast 10 years after having so qualified, practised as an advocate or an attorney or lectured in law at a university; \nor (ii) is a person who, by reason of his or her training and experience, has expertise in the field of constitutional \n\n \n \n\n133 \n\n\f \n \n\nincumbents are judges, not sages; their discipline is the law, not ethics or philosophy and \ncertainly not politics. \n\nKRIEGLER J \n\n \n[208]  The exercise is to establish whether there is an invalid infringement of a right protected by \n\nChapter Three.  This \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\"calls for a 'two-stage' approach.  First, has there been a contravention of a guaranteed \nright?  If so, is it justified under the limitation clause?\"7 \n\n \nFor the first step, one need go no further than section  9 of the Constitution, which could \nnot possibly be plainer: \n\n\"Every person shall have the right to life.\" \n\nWhatever else section 9 may mean in other contexts, with regard to which I express no \nview, at the very least it indicates that the State may not deliberately deprive any person \nof his or her life.  As against that general prohibition section 277(1) of the Criminal \nProcedure Act sanctions a judicial order for the deprivation of a person's life.  The two \nprovisions are clearly not reconcilable.  Therefore, the latter provision is liable to be \nstruck down under section 4(1) of the Constitution, unless it is saved by the second step \nof the analysis -application of the limitations clause. \n\n                                                                                                                                                                   \n\nlaw relevant to the application of this Constitution and the law of the Republic.\" \n\n     7Per Kentridge AJ, in S v Zuma and Others 1995 (4) BCLR 401, 414 (SA).  The \"limitation clause\" he refers \nto is section 33(1) of the Constitution. \n\n \n \n\n134 \n\n\fKRIEGLER J \n\n \n \n[209]  During the second step of the exercise one must ask whether that infringement of the right to life \nis reasonable and also whether it is justifiable in an open and democratic society based \non freedom and equality (sections 33(1)(a)(i) & (ii)).8  As I am satisfied that section \n277(1)(a) does not meet the threshold test of reasonableness, I find it unnecessary to ask \nwhether it is justifiable in the kind of society postulated.  Nor do I consider the meaning \nof section 33(1)(b), which is discussed in paragraphs 132, 133 and 134 of the main \njudgment and paragraphs 193, 194 and 195 of the judgment of Kentridge AJ.9  In respect \nthereof I express no opinion. \n\n                                                 \n\n     8The questions may well be asked what the distinction is between reasonable and justifiable and whether one \ntest can be met and not the other.  Be that as it may, this case is so clear that the distinction, if any, between the \ntwo criteria need not be considered. \n\n     9Relating to the meaning and effect of the prohibition in section 33(1)(b) against a limitation which \"negate[s] \nthe essential content of the right in question.\" \n\n \n \n\n135 \n\n\f \n \n[210]  I also find it unnecessary to probe the outer limits of what is reasonable.  At the very least the \nreasonableness of a provision which flies directly in the face of an entrenched right \nwould have to be cogently established.  Furthermore a provision relating to so basic and \nso precious a right as the right to life itself (without which all other rights are nought), \nwould have to be manifestly reasonable.10 \n\nKRIEGLER J \n\n \n[211]  We were favoured with literally thousands of pages of material in support of and opposed to the \ndeath penalty, ranging from the religious, ethical, philosophical and ideological to the \nmathematical and statistical.  Mr Von Lieres, SC, who argued the retentionist cause with \ngreat skill, in essence sought to bring the death sentence within the protection of section \n33(1) on the strength of its deterrent and retributive value.  The main judgment deals \nwith these two considerations11 and I merely wish to make a few additional observations \nregarding deterrence.12   \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n     10The reasonableness of other limitations on the right to life does not arise here.  Suffice it to say that there \nmust always be a proportionality between any right and the limitation thereof sought to be saved under section \n33(1). \n\n     11Paragraphs 116 to 127 on deterrence and 129 to 131 on retribution. \n\n     12No more need be said about retribution than has been said by my colleagues.  See also paragraph 203 of the \njudgment of Kentridge AJ and paragraph 185 of the judgment of Didcott J. \n\n \n \n\n136 \n\n\f \n \n[212]  Nearly a quarter of a century ago the US Supreme Court decided the watershed case of Furman \nv Georgia.13  In the course of a compendiously researched opinion, Marshall J reviewed \nvirtually every scrap of Anglo-American evidence for and against capital punishment.  In \nthe course of his \"long and tedious journey\" (his own description) he made the crucial \nfinding that 200 years of research had established \n\nKRIEGLER J \n\n \n\n \n\n\"that  capital  punishment  serves  no  purpose  that  life  imprisonment  could  not  serve \nequally well.\"14 \n\nA decade later the Indian Supreme Court surveyed the international authorities for and \nagainst the death penalty in Bachan Singh's case.15  Since then a great deal more has \nbeen written in support of both the abolitionist and the retentionist schools.  But when all \nis said and done the answer is still what it was to Marshall J in Furman's case: the death \npenalty  has  no  demonstrable  penological  value  over  and  above  that  of  long-term \nimprisonment.  No empirical study, no statistical exercise and no theoretical analysis has \nbeen able to demonstrate that capital punishment has any deterrent force greater than that \nof a really heavy sentence of imprisonment.  That is the ineluctable conclusion to be \ndrawn from the mass of data so thoroughly canvassed in the written and oral arguments \npresented to us. \n\n \n[213]  Another equally ineluctable conclusion then is that capital punishment cannot be vindicated by \nthe provisions of section 33(1) of the Constitution.16  It simply cannot be reasonable to \n\n                                                 \n\n     13408 US 238 (1972). \n\n     14Id. at 359. \n\n     15Bachan Singh v State of Punjab (1980) 2 SCC 684, quoted in paragraph 76 of the main judgment. \n\n16\n\n      The provisions of section 277(1)(b), which sanction the death penalty for treason committed at a time when \n\n \n \n\n137 \n\n\f \n \n\nsanction judicial killing without knowing whether it has any marginal deterrent value. \n\nKRIEGLER J \n\n \n[214]  Having concluded that capital punishment is inconsistent with section 9 of the Constitution and \ncannot  be  saved  by  section  33(1),  I  find  it  unnecessary  to  consider  its  possible \ninconsistency with any other fundamental rights protected by Chapter Three.  Vigilant \nprotection of the right to human dignity (section 10) and of the immunity from cruel, \ninhuman or degrading punishment (section 11(2)) is undoubtedly essential.  So too \narbitrariness in the imposition of any sentence is fatally inconsistent with the demand for \nequality  so  emphatically  mandated  in  sections  8(1)  and  (2).    I  do  not  want  to  be \nunderstood as disagreeing with the views expressed by any of my colleagues in regard to \nthose rights and their importance; but in the hierarchy of values and fundamental rights \nguaranteed under chapter 3, I see them as ranking below the right to life.  Indeed, they \nare  subsumed  by  that  most  basic  of  rights.    Inasmuch  as  capital  punishment,  by \ndefinition, strikes at the heart of the right to life, the debate need go no further. \n\n \n \n[215]  LANGA  J:  I agree with the conclusions reached by Chaskalson P and generally with the \nreasons he advances in his exhaustive and erudite judgment.  I concur in the order he has \nproposed.  I wish to put additional emphasis on some of the aspects he has dealt with. \n\n \n[216]  The death sentence, in terms of the provisions of section 277 of the Criminal Procedure Act, No. \n\n51 of 1977, is unconstitutional, violating as it does: \n\n \n\n(a) \n\nthe  right  to  life  which  is  guaranteed  to  every  person  by  section  9  of  the \nConstitution; \n\n                                                                                                                                                                   \n\nthe Republic is in a state of war, do not arise for consideration in this case.  That is a wholly different situation \nwhich requires independent evaluation. \n\n \n \n\n138 \n\n\f \n \n\n(b) \n(c) \n\nthe right to respect for human dignity guaranteed in section 10; \nthe right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment as set \nout in section 11(2).   \n\n \n[217]  For the reasons set out in Didcott J's judgment, I place more emphasis on the right to life.  \nSection  9  of  the  Constitution  proclaims  it  in  unqualified  terms.    It  is  the  most \nfundamental of all rights,1 the supreme human right.2  I do not consider it necessary or \ndesirable to define the exact scope of the right, save to make two points, namely: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nIt does mean that every person has the right not to be deliberately put to death by \nthe State as punishment, as envisaged in section 277 of the Criminal Procedure \nAct. \n\nI do not exclude the application of the limitations clause to the right to life.  Any \nlaw which seeks to limit the right will have to comply with the requirements of \nsection 33(1) of the Constitution.   For the reasons set out in Chaskalson P's \njudgment, the requirements have not been met;  the State has been unable to \njustify the limitation which is imposed on the right to life by section 277 of the \nCriminal Procedure Act.  I cannot accept that it is \"reasonable,\" as required by \nsection 33(1) of the Constitution, to override what is the most fundamental of all \nrights, without clear proof that the deterrence value of the penalty is substantially \nhigher than that which the imposition of a suitably long period of imprisonment \nhas.  This has not been proved.  Because of the view I take, I find it unnecessary \n\n                                                 \n     1 See the remarks of Lord Bridge in Bugdaycay v Secretary of State 1987(1) All ER 940 at 952b. \n\n     2 See paragraph 82 of Chaskalson P\u2019s judgment. \n\n139 \n\n\f \n \n\nLANGA J \nto deal with the other requirements of section 33(1) of the Constitution.  \n\n \n[218]  The emphasis I place on the right to life is, in part, influenced by the recent experiences of our \npeople in this country.  The history of the past decades has been such that the value of \nlife and human dignity have been demeaned.  Political, social and other factors created a \nclimate of violence resulting in a culture of retaliation and vengeance.  In the process, \nrespect for life and for the inherent dignity of every person became the main casualties.  \nThe State has been part of this degeneration, not only because of its role in the conflicts \nof the past, but also by retaining punishments which did not testify to a high regard for \nthe dignity of the person and the value of every human life. \n\n \n[219]  The primacy of the right to life and its relationship to punishment needs to be emphasized also in \nview of our constitutional history.  The doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty meant, \nvirtually, that the State could do anything, enact any law, subject only to procedural \ncorrectness.3 \n\n \n[220]  When the Constitution was enacted, it signalled a dramatic change in the system of governance \nfrom one based on rule by parliament to a constitutional state in which the rights of \nindividuals are guaranteed by the Constitution.  It also signalled a new dispensation, as it \nwere,  where  rule  by  force  would  be  replaced  by  democratic  principles  and  a \ngovernmental system based on the precepts of equality and freedom. \n\n \n[221]  It may well be that for millions in this country, the effect of the change has yet to be felt in a \nmaterial sense.  For all of us though, a framework has been created in which a new \nculture must take root and develop.  \n\n                                                 \n\n     3 S v Tuhadeleni and Others 1969(1) SA 153 (A) at 172D - 173F; Baxter, Administrative Law, page 30 \n(1984). \n\n \n \n\n140 \n\n\fLANGA J \n\n \n \n \n[222]  Implicit in the provisions and tone of the Constitution are values of a more mature society, \nwhich relies on moral persuasion rather than force;  on example rather than coercion.  In \nthis new context, then, the role of the State becomes clear.  For good or for worse, the \nState is a role model for our society.4  A culture of respect for human life and dignity, \nbased on the values reflected in the Constitution, has to be engendered, and the State \nmust take the lead.  In acting out this role, the State not only preaches respect for the law \nand that the killing must stop, but it demonstrates in the best way possible, by example, \nsociety\u2019s  own  regard  for  human  life  and  dignity  by  refusing  to  destroy  that  of  the \ncriminal.  Those who are inclined to kill need to be told why it is wrong.  The reason \nsurely must be the principle that the value of human life is inestimable, and it is a value \nwhich the State must uphold by example as well.  As pointed out by Mr Justice Schaefer \nof the Supreme Court of Illinois:5 \n\n \n\n \n\n\"The methods we employ in the enforcement of our criminal law have aptly been called \nthe measures by which the quality of our civilisation may be judged.\" \n\n                                                \n\n \n\n     4 Brandeis J in his dissenting opinion in Olmstead v United States, 277 US 438, 485 (1928) put it succinctly: \n\"Our Government is the potent, the omni-present teacher.  For good or for ill, it teaches the whole of our people \nby its example.\" \n\n     5 In his Oliver Wendell Holmes lecture at the Harvard Law School, reprinted under the heading Federalism \nand State Criminal Procedure, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 26 (1956).  The passage was referred to with approval in \nCoppedge v United States, 369 US 438, 449 (1962).  \n\n \n \n\n141 \n\n\fLANGA J \n\n \n \n[223]  The ethos of the new culture is expressed in the much-quoted provision on National Unity and \nReconciliation which forms part of the Constitution. Chaskalson P quotes the various \ncomponents of it in paragraphs 7 and 130 of his judgment.  It describes the Constitution \nas a \"bridge\" between the past and the future;  from \"the past of a deeply divided society \ncharacterised by strife, conflict, untold suffering and injustice, and a future founded on \nthe recognition of human rights, ... for all South Africans ...\"; and finally, it suggests a \nchange  in  mental  attitude  from  vengeance  to  an  appreciation  of  the  need  for \nunderstanding, from retaliation to reparation and from victimisation to ubuntu.  The \nConstitution does not define this last-mentioned concept. \n\n \n[224]  The concept is of some relevance to the values we need to uphold.  It is a culture which places \nsome  emphasis  on  communality  and  on  the  interdependence  of  the  members  of  a \ncommunity.  It recognises a person's status as a human being, entitled to unconditional \nrespect, dignity, value and acceptance from the members of the community such person \nhappens  to  be  part  of.    It  also  entails  the  converse,  however.  The  person  has  a \ncorresponding duty to give the same respect, dignity, value and acceptance to each \nmember of that community.  More importantly, it regulates the exercise of rights by the \nemphasis it lays on sharing and co-responsibility and the mutual enjoyment of rights by \nall.  It is perhaps best illustrated in the following remarks in the judgment of the Court of \nAppeal of the Republic of Tanzania in DPP v Pete,6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\"The second important principle or characteristic to be borne in mind when interpreting \nour Constitution is a corollary of the reality of co-existence of the individual and society, \nand also the reality of co-existence of rights and duties of the individual on the one hand, \nand the collective of communitarian rights and duties of society on the other. In effect \nthis co-existence means that the rights and duties of the individual are limited by the \nrights and duties of society, and vice versa.\"  \n\n[225]  An outstanding feature of ubuntu in a community sense is the value it puts on life and human \ndignity.  The dominant theme of the culture is that the life of another person is at least as \nvaluable as one's own.  Respect for the dignity of every person is integral to this concept. \n During violent conflicts and times when violent crime is rife, distraught members of \n\n                                                 \n\n     6 [1991] LRC (Const) 553 at 566b-d, per Nyalali CJ, Makame and Ramadhani JJA. \n\n \n \n\n142 \n\n\f \n \n\nsociety decry the loss of ubuntu. Thus heinous crimes are the antithesis of ubuntu. \nTreatment that is cruel, inhuman or degrading is bereft of ubuntu.  \n\nLANGA J \n\n \n[226]  We have all been affected, in some way or other, by the \"strife, conflict, untold suffering and \ninjustice\" of the recent past.  Some communities have been ravaged much more than \nothers.  In some, there is hardly anyone who has not been a victim in some way or who \nhas  not  lost  a  close  relative  in  senseless  violence.    Some  of  the  violence  has  been \nperpetrated through the machinery of the State, in order to ensure the perpetuation of a \nstatus quo that was fast running out of time.  But all this was violence on human beings \nby human beings.  Life became cheap, almost worthless. \n\n \n[227]  It was against a background of the loss of respect for human life and the inherent dignity with \nattaches  to  every  person  that  a  spontaneous  call  has  arisen  among  sections  of  the \ncommunity for a return to ubuntu.  A number of references to ubuntu have already been \nmade in various texts but largely without explanation of the concept.7  It has however \nalways  been  mentioned  in  the  context  of  it  being  something  to  be  desired,  a \ncommendable attribute which the nation should strive for. \n\n \n[228]  At first blush, it may sound odd that the issue of the right to life is being decided on the basis of \npersons condemned to death for killing other human beings.  In this regard, it is relevant \nto note that there are some 400 people presently under sentence of death for acts of \nviolence.  That in itself means that there are probably an equivalent number of victims \nwhose lives have been prematurely, violently, terminated.  They died without having had \nany recourse to law.  For them there was no \"due process.\" \n\n \n[229]  That is why, during argument, a tentative proposition was made that a person who has killed \nanother  has  forfeited  the  right  to  life.    Although  the  precise  implications  of  this \nsuggestion  were  not  thoroughly  canvassed,  this  cannot  be  so.    The  test  of  our \n\n \n                                                \n\n     7 See paragraphs 130 and 131 of Chaskalson P's judgment.  The concept has been referred to also by Madala \nJ, Mahomed J and Mokgoro J in their separate concurring judgments in this matter. \n\n \n \n\n143 \n\n\f \n \n\ncommitment to a culture of rights lies in our ability to respect the rights not only of the \nweakest, but also of the worst among us.  A person does not become \"fair game\" to be \nkilled at the behest of the State, because he has killed. \n\nLANGA J \n\n \n[230]  The protection afforded by the Constitution is applicable to every person.  That includes the \nweak, the poor and the vulnerable.  It includes others as well who might appear not to \nneed special protection;  it includes criminals and all those who have placed themselves \non the wrong side of the law.  The Constitution guarantees them their right, as persons, to \nlife,  to  dignity  and  to  protection  against  torture  or  cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading \npunishment or treatment. \n\n \n[231]  The violent acts of those who destroy life cannot be condoned, neither should anyone think that \nthe abolition of the sentence of death means that the crime is regarded as anything but \none of extreme seriousness.  The sentence itself was an indication of society's abhorrence \nfor the cruel and inhuman treatment of others.  That moral outrage has been expressed in \nthe strongest terms that society could muster. \n\n \n[232]  Severe punishments must be meted out where deserved, but they should never be excessive.  As \n\nBrennan J observed in his concurring judgment in Furman v Georgia,8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\". . . a severe punishment must not be excessive.  A punishment is excessive under this \nprinciple if it is unnecessary . . . [i]f there is a significantly less severe punishment \nadequate to achieve the purposes for which the punishment is inflicted, the punishment \ninflicted is unnecessary and therefore excessive.\" \n\n                                                \n \n\n     8 408 US 238, 279 (1972). \n\n \n \n\n144 \n\n\f \n\nRighteous anger against those who destroy the human life  and dignity of others must be \nappropriately expressed by the Courts;9  but in doing so, the State must not send the \nwrong message, namely, that the value of human life is variable.10  Society cannot now \nsuccumb to the doctrine of \u201can eye for an eye.\u201d  Its actions must be informed by the high \nvalues which reflect the quality of this nation's civilization.   \n\n \n[233]  The Constitution constrains society to express its condemnation and its justifiable anger in a \nmanner which preserves society's own morality.  The State should not make itself guilty \nof conduct which violates that which it is in the community's interests to nurture.  The \nConstitution, in deference to our humanity and sense of dignity, does not allow us to kill \nin cold blood in order to deter others from killing.  Nor does it allow us to \u201ckill criminals \nsimply to get even with them.\"11  We are not to stoop to the level of the criminal. \n\n \n[234]  It follows from the remarks above that as a \u2018punishment\u2019 the death penalty is a violation of the \nright to life.  It is cruel, inhuman and degrading.  It is also a severe affront to human \ndignity.  The \u2018death row phenomenon\u2019 merely aggravates the position.  Section 277 of \nthe Criminal Procedure Act cannot be saved by the provisions of section 33(1) of the \nConstitution in respect of any of the rights affected.  The punishment is not reasonable \non  any  basis.    In  view  of  the  available  alternative  sentence  of  a  long  term  of \n\n                                                 \n\n     9 See R v Karg 1961(1) SA 231(A) at 236A. \n\n     10 Brennan J in Furman v Georgia, supra, at 273 expressed himself thus:  \". . . even the vilest criminal \nremains a human being possessed of common human dignity.\" \n\n     11 Per Brennan J in Furman v Georgia, supra, at 305. \n\n \n \n\n145 \n\n\f \n\nimprisonment, it is also unnecessary. \n\n \n \n[235]  MADALA J:  I am in agreement with the views expressed in the judgment of Chaskalson P and \nwith his decision on the unconstitutionality of the death penalty.  The punishment, is in \nmy view, clearly offensive to the cardinal principles for which our Constitution stands.  \n\n \n\nHowever, while I concur, as aforesaid, I believe that there are some additional matters \nthat need to be mentioned and aspects that should be emphasised, and I proceed to do so \nbriefly. \n\n \n[236]  The death penalty is unique.  As stated by Stewart J in Furman v Georgia 408 US at 306: \n \n\n\"The penalty of death differs from all other forms of criminal punishment, not in degree \nbut  in  kind.    It  is  unique  in  its  total  irrevocability.    It  is  unique  in  its  rejection  of \nrehabilitation of the convict as a basic purpose of criminal justice.  And it is unique, \nfinally, in its absolute renunciation of all that is embodied in our concept of humanity.\" \n\n \n\nThis statement was more recently (1991) re-affirmed by Scalia J, who delivered the \njudgment of the court in Harmelin v Michigan 501 US 957, and noted that even the most \nsevere sentence of life imprisonment cannot compare with death. \n\n \n[237]  The Constitution in its post-amble declares: \n \n\n\"... there is a need for understanding but not vengeance, and for reparation but not for \nretaliation, a need for ubuntu but not victimisation.\" \n\n \n\nThe concept \"ubuntu\" appears for the first time in the post-amble, but it is a concept that \npermeates  the  Constitution  generally  and  more  particularly  Chapter  Three  which \nembodies the entrenched fundamental human rights.  The concept carries in it the ideas \nof humaneness, social justice and fairness. \n\n \n[238]  It was argued by Mr Bizos, on behalf of the Government, that the post-amble enjoins the people \nof South Africa to open a new chapter which envisages the country playing a leading role \n\n \n \n\n146 \n\n\f \n \n\nMADALA J \n\nin the upholding of human rights.  He submitted further, that the Government favoured \nthe abolition of the death penalty because it believed that such punishment could not be \nreconciled  with  the  fundamental  rights  contained  in  the  Constitution,  and  that  its \napplication diminished the dignity of our society as a whole. \n\n \n[239]  In my rejection of the death penalty as a form of punishment, I do not intend, nor do my \ncolleagues, to condone murder, rape, armed robbery with aggravating circumstances and \nthose other crimes which are punishable by a sentence of death in terms of Section 277 \nof the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977.  These criminal acts are, and remain, as \nheinous, vicious and as reprehensible as they ever were, and do not belong in civilised \nsociety.  The death penalty is a punishment which involves so much pain and suffering \nthat civilised society ought not to tolerate it even in spite of the present high rate of \ncrime.  And society ought to tolerate the death penalty even less when considering that it \nhas not been proved that it has any greater deterrent effect on would-be murderers than \nlife imprisonment. \n\n \n[240]  The aspect of irrevocability of the death penalty has been canvassed adequately in the judgment \nof Chaskalson P and I propose to say no more on that score (See paragraphs 26 and 54). \n\n \n[241]  As observed before, the death penalty rejects the possibility of rehabilitation of the convicted \npersons, condemning them as \"no good\", once and for all, and drafting them to the death \nrow and the gallows.  One must then ask whether such rejection of rehabilitation as a \npossibility accords with the concept of ubuntu. \n\n \n[242]  One of the relative theories of punishment (the so-called purposive theories) is the reformative \ntheory, which considers punishment to be a means to an end, and not an end in itself - \nthat end being the reformation of the criminal as a person, so that the person may, at a \ncertain stage, become a normal law-abiding and useful member of the community once \nagain.  The person and the personality of the offender are the point of focus rather than \nthe crime, although the crime is, however, not forgotten.  And in terms of this theory of \npunishment and as a necessary consequence of its application, the offender has to be \n\n \n \n\n147 \n\n\f \n \n\nimprisoned for a long period for the purpose of rehabilitation.  By treatment and training \nthe offender is rehabilitated, or, at the very least, ceases to be a danger to society. \n\nMADALA J \n\n \n[243]  This, in my view, accords fully with the concept of ubuntu which is so well enunciated in the \n\nConstitution. \n\n \n[244]  Our courts have found room for the exercise of ubuntu, as appears from the many cases where \nthey have found that despite the heinousness of the offence and the brutality with which \nit was perpetrated, there were factors in the offenders' favour, indicating that they were, \nin spite of the criminal conduct of which they were convicted, responsible members of \nsociety, and were worthy and capable of rehabilitation.  (See S v Mbotshwa 1993(2) \nSACR 468(A) at 468J-469F; S v Ramba 1990(2) SACR 334(A) at 335H-336E; S v \nNgcobo 1992(2) SACR 515(A) at 515H-516A; Contra:  S v Bosman 1992(1) SACR \n115(A) at 116G-117F) \n\n \n[245]  Against ubuntu must be seen the other side, the inhuman side of mankind, in terms of which the \ndeath penalty violates Section 11(2) of the Constitution in that it is \"cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading treatment or punishment\". \n\n \n[246]  In Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe v Attorney-General, Zimbabwe \n\n1993(4) SA 239(ZSC) at 268E-H, Gubbay CJ, observed: \n\n \n\n\"From  the  moment  he  enters  the  condemned  cell,  the  prisoner  is  enmeshed  in  a \ndehumanising environment of near hopelessness.  He is in a place where the sole object \nis to preserve his life so that he may be executed.  The condemned prisoner is 'the living \ndead' ... He is kept only with other death sentenced prisoners - with those whose appeals \nhave been dismissed and who await death or reprieve; or those whose appeals are still to \nbe heard or are pending judgment.  While the right to an appeal may raise the prospect \nof being allowed to live, the intensity of the trauma is much increased by knowledge of \nits dismissal.  The hope of a reprieve is all that is left.  Throughout all this time the \ncondemned prisoner constantly broods over his fate.  The horrifying spectre of being \nhanged by the neck and the apprehension of being made to suffer a painful and lingering \ndeath is, if at all, never far from mind.  Grim accounts exist of hangings not properly \nperformed.\" \n\n \n[247]  Convicted persons in death row invariably find themselves there for a long time as they make \n\n \n \n\n148 \n\n\f \n \n\nMADALA J \n\nevery effort to exhaust all possible review avenues open to them.  All this time they are \nsubjected to a fate of ever increasing fear and distress.  They know not what their future \nis and whether their efforts will come to nought; they live under the sword of Damocles - \nthey will be advised any day about their appointment with the hangman.  It is true that \nthey might have shown no mercy at all to their victims, but we do not and should not \ntake our standards and values from the murderer.  We must, on the other hand, impose \nour standards and values on the murderer. \n\n \n[248]  In  the  aforementioned  Zimbabwe  case,  the  court  concluded  that  the  incarceration  of  the \ncondemned person under those conditions was in conflict with the provisions of Section \n15(1)  of  the  Zimbabwe  Constitution,  which  like  our  Constitution,  has  entrenched \nguarantees against torture or inhuman and degrading punishment. \n\n \n[249]  The so-called \"death row phenomenon\" also came under attack in the case of Soering v United \n\nKingdom (1989) 11 EHRR 439. \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom the statistics supplied by the Attorney-General and from what one gleans daily \nfrom the newspapers and other media, we live at a time when the high crime rate is \nunprecedented, when the streets of our cities and towns rouse fear and despair in the \nheart, rather than pride and hope, and this in turn, robs us of objectivity and personal \nconcern for our brethren.  But, as Marshall J put it in Furman v Georgia (supra) at 371: \n\n\"The measure of a country's greatness is its ability to retain compassion in time of \ncrisis.\" \n\n \n[250]  This, in my view, also accords with ubuntu - and calls for a balancing of the interest of society \nagainst  those  of  the  individual,  for  the  maintenance  of  law  and  order,  but  not  for \ndehumanising and degrading the individual. \n\n \n[251]  We must stand tallest in these troubled times and realise that every accused person who is sent \nto jail is not beyond being rehabilitated - properly counselled - or, at the very least, \n\n \n \n\n149 \n\n\f \n \n\nbeyond losing the will and capacity to do evil. \n\nMADALA J \n\n[252]  A further aspect which I wish to mention is the question of traditional African jurisprudence, \nand the degree to which such values have not been researched for the purposes of the \ndetermination of the issue of capital punishment. \n\n \n[253]  Ms Davids, who appeared on behalf of the Black Advocates Forum, in its capacity as amicus \n\ncuriae, touched on but did not fully argue this matter. \n\n \n[254]  She submitted that we could not determine the question of the constitutionality or otherwise of \nthe death sentence without reference to further evidence which would include the views, \naspirations and opinions of the historically disadvantaged and previously oppressed \npeople of South Africa, who also constitute the majority of our society. \n\n \n[255]  As I understood her argument, the issue of capital punishment could not be determined in an \nopen and democratic society without the active participation of the black majority.  This, \nin  my  view,  would  be  tantamount  to  canvassing  public  opinion  among  the  black \npopulation for the decisions of our courts.  I do not agree with this submission, if it \nimplies that this Court or any other court must function according to public opinion. \n\n \n[256]  In order to arrive at an answer as to the constitutionality or otherwise of the death penalty or any \nenactment, we do not have to canvass the opinions and attitudes of the public.  Ours is to \ninterpret the provisions of the Constitution as they stand and if any matter is in conflict \nwith the Constitution, we have to strike it down. \n\n \n[257]  We, as judges, are oath bound to defend the Constitution.  This obligation, in turn, requires that \nany  enactment  of  Parliament  should  be  judged  by  standards  laid  down  by  the \nConstitution.  The judiciary has the duty of implementing the constitutional safeguards \nthat  protect  individual  rights.    When  the  State  seeks  to  take  away  the  individual \nfundamental right to life, the safeguards of the Constitution should be examined with \nspecial diligence.  When it appears that an act of Parliament conflicts with the provisions \nof the Constitution, we have no choice but to enforce the paramount commands of the \n\n \n \n\n150 \n\n\f \n\nConstitution.  We are sworn to do no less. \n\n \n[258]  I  agree  with  Ms  Davids'  submission  about  the  need  to  bring  in  the  traditional  African \njurisprudence  to  these  matters,  to  the  extent that such is applicable, and would not \nconfine such research to South Africa only, but to Africa in general. \n\n \n[259]  For purposes of the determination of the question of the constitutionality of the death penalty, \nhowever, it is, in my view, not necessary or even desirable that public opinion should be \nsought on the matter in the manner she suggests. \n\n \n[260]  In my view, the death penalty does not belong to the society envisaged in the Constitution, is \nclearly in conflict with the Constitution generally and runs counter to the concept of \nubuntu; additionally and just as importantly, it violates the provisions of Section 11(2) of \nthe Constitution and, for those reasons, should be declared unconstitutional and of no \nforce and effect. \n\n \n[261]  MAHOMED  J:    I  have  had  the  privilege  of  reading  the  full  and    erudite  judgment  of \nChaskalson P in this matter.  I agree with the order proposed by him and in general with \nthe reasons given by him for that order.  Regard being had, however, to the crucial \nconsequences of the debate on capital punishment, and the multiplicity of potential \nconstitutional factors and nuances which impact on its resolution, I think it is desirable \nfor me to set out briefly some of my responses to this debate in order to explain why I \nhave come to the conclusion that capital punishment is prohibited by the Constitution. \n\n \n[262]  All Constitutions seek to articulate, with differing degrees of intensity and detail, the shared \naspirations  of  a  nation;    the  values  which  bind  its  people,  and  which  discipline  its \ngovernment  and  its  national  institutions;    the  basic  premises  upon  which  judicial, \nlegislative  and  executive  power  is  to  be  wielded;    the  constitutional  limits  and  the \nconditions upon which that power is to be exercised;  the national ethos which defines \nand regulates that exercise;  and the moral and ethical direction  which that nation has \nidentified for its future.  In some countries, the Constitution only formalizes, in a legal \n\n \n \n\n151 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nMAHOMED J \n\ninstrument, a historical consensus of values and aspirations evolved incrementally from a \nstable and unbroken past to accommodate the needs of the future.  The South African \nConstitution is different:  it retains from the past only what is defensible and represents a \ndecisive  break  from,  and  a  ringing  rejection  of,  that  part  of  the  past  which  is \ndisgracefully racist, authoritarian, insular, and repressive and a vigorous identification of \nand commitment to a democratic, universalistic, caring and aspirationally egalitarian \nethos, expressly articulated in the Constitution.  The contrast between the past which it \nrepudiates and the future to which it seeks to commit the nation is stark and dramatic.  \nThe past institutionalized and legitimized racism.  The Constitution expresses in its \npreamble the need for a \"new order .. in which there is equality between ... people of all \nraces\".  Chapter 3 of the Constitution extends the contrast, in every relevant area of \nendeavour (subject only to the obvious limitations of section 33).  The past was redolent \nwith statutes which assaulted the human dignity of persons on the grounds of race and \ncolour  alone;    section  10  constitutionally  protects  that  dignity.  The  past  accepted, \npermitted,  perpetuated  and \ninstitutionalized  pervasive  and  manifestly  unfair \ndiscrimination against women and persons of colour; the preamble, section 8 and the \npostamble  seek  to  articulate  an  ethos  which  not  only  rejects  its  rationale  but \nunmistakenly recognizes the clear justification for the reversal of the accumulated legacy \nof  such  discrimination.    The  past  permitted  detention  without  trial;    section  11(1) \nprohibits it.  The past permitted degrading treatment of persons;  section 11(2) renders it \nunconstitutional.  The past arbitrarily repressed the freedoms of expression, assembly, \nassociation and movement;  sections 15, 16, 17 and 18 accord to these freedoms the \nstatus of \"fundamental rights\".  The past limited the right to vote to a minority;  section \n21 extends it to every citizen.  The past arbitrarily denied to citizens on the grounds of \nrace and colour, the right to hold and acquire property;  section 26 expressly secures it.  \nSuch a jurisprudential past created what the postamble to the Constitution recognizes as \na society \"characterized by strife, conflict, untold suffering and injustice\".  What the \nConstitution  expressly  aspires  to  do  is  to  provide  a  transition  from  these  grossly \nunacceptable features of the past to a conspicuously contrasting \n\n\"future founded on the recognition of human rights, democracy and \n\n152 \n\n\f \n \n\nMAHOMED J \n\npeaceful co-existence and development opportunities for all South \nAfricans, irrespective of colour, race, class, belief or sex\". \n\n \n \n[263]  The  postamble  to  the  Constitution  gives  expression  to  the  new  ethos  of  the  nation  by  a \ncommitment to \"open a  new chapter in the history of our country\", by lamenting the \ntransgressions  of  \"human  rights\"  and  \"humanitarian  principles\"  in  the  past,  and \narticulating a \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\"need for understanding, but not for vengeance, a need for reparation but not retaliation, a need \nfor ubuntu but not for victimization\". \n\n\"The need for ubuntu\" expresses the ethos of an instinctive capacity for and enjoyment of \nlove  towards  our  fellow  men  and  women;    the  joy  and  the  fulfilment  involved  in \nrecognizing their innate humanity;  the reciprocity this generates in interaction within the \ncollective community;  the richness of the creative emotions which it engenders and the \nmoral energies which it releases both in the givers and the society which they serve and \nare served by. \n\n \n[264]  It is against this historical background and ethos that the constitutionality of capital punishment \n\nmust be determined. \n\n \n \n[265]  The death penalty sanctions the deliberate annihilation of life.  As I have previously said it \n \n\n\"is  the  ultimate  and  the  most  incomparably  extreme  form  of \npunishment...  It  is  the  last,  the  most  devastating  and  the  most \nirreversible recourse of the criminal law, involving as it necessarily \ndoes,  the  planned  and  calculated  termination  of  life  itself;    the \ndestruction of the greatest and most precious gift which is bestowed \non all humankind\" (S v Mhlongo 1994 (1) SACR 584(A) at 587 e-g). \n\nThis \"planned and calculated termination of life itself\" was permitted in the past which \npreceded the Constitution.  Is it now permissible?  Those responsible for the enactment \n\n153 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n \n\nMAHOMED J \n\nof the Constitution, could, if they had so wished, have treated the issue as a substantially \npolitical  and  moral  issue  justifying  a  political  choice,  clearly  expressed  in  the \nConstitution, either retaining or prohibiting the death sentence.  They elected not to do \nso, leaving it to this Court to resolve the issue, as a constitutional issue. \n\n \n[266]  The difference between a political election made by a legislative organ and decisions reached by \na judicial organ, like the Constitutional Court, is crucial.  The legislative organ exercises \na political discretion, taking into account the political preferences of the electorate which \nvotes political decision-makers into office.  Public opinion therefore legitimately plays a \nsignificant, sometimes even decisive, role in the resolution of a public issue such as the \ndeath penalty.  The judicial process is entirely different.  What the Constitutional Court \nis required to do in order to resolve an issue, is to examine the relevant provisions of the \nConstitution,  their text and their context; the interplay between the different provisions; \nlegal  precedent  relevant  to  the  resolution  of  the  problem  both  in  South  Africa  and \nabroad;  the domestic common law and public international law impacting on its possible \nsolution;  factual and historical considerations bearing on the problem; the significance \nand meaning of  the language used in the relevant provisions;  the content and the sweep \nof the ethos expressed in the structure of the Constitution;  the balance to be struck \nbetween different and sometimes potentially conflicting considerations reflected in its \ntext; and by a judicious interpretation and assessment of all these factors to determine \nwhat the Constitution permits and what it prohibits. \n\n \n[267]  Adopting that approach, I am satisfied that the death penalty as a form of punishment violates \ncrucial sections of the Constitution and that it is not saved by the limitations permitted in \nterms of section 33.  I wish briefly to set out my reasons for that conclusion. \n\n \n[268]  In the first place, it offends section 9 of the Constitution which prescribes in peremptory terms \nthat  \"every  person  shall  have  the  right  to  life\".    What  does  that  mean?    What  is  a \n\"person\"?  When does \"personhood\" and \"life\" begin?  Can there be a conflict between \nthe \"right to life\" in section 9 and the right of a mother to \"personal privacy\" in terms of \nsection 13 and her possible right to the freedom and control of her body?  Does the \"right \n\n \n \n\n154 \n\n\f \n \n\nMAHOMED J \n\nto life\", within the meaning of section 9, preclude the practitioner of scientific medicine \nfrom withdrawing the modern mechanisms which mechanically and artificially enable \nphysical breathing in a terminal patient to continue, long beyond the point, when the \n\"brain is dead\" and beyond the point when a human being ceases to be \"human\" although \nsome unfocussed claim to qualify as a \"being\" is still retained?  If not, can such a \npractitioner  go  beyond  the  point  of  passive  withdrawal  into  the  area  of  active \nintervention?  When?  Under what circumstances? \n\n \n[269]  It is, for the purposes of the present case, unnecessary to give to the word \"life\" in section 9 a \ncomprehensive legal definition, which will accommodate the answer to these and other \ncomplex questions.  Whatever be the proper resolution of such issues, should they arise \nin the future, it is possible to approach the constitutionality of the death sentence by a \nquestion with a sharper and narrower focus, thus: \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\"Does the right to life guaranteed by section 9, include the right of every person, not to \nbe deliberately killed by the State, through a systematically planned act of execution \nsanctioned by the State as a mode of punishment and performed by an executioner \nremunerated for this purpose from public funds?\" \n\nThe answer to that question, is in my view:  \"Yes, every person has that right\".  It \nimmediately  distinguishes  that  right  from  some  other  obvious  rights  referred  to  in \nargument, such as for example the right of a person in life-threatening circumstances to \ntake the life of the aggressor in self-defence or even the acts of the State, in confronting \nan insurrection or in the course of War. \n\n \n[270]  The deliberate annihilation of the life of a person, systematically planned by the State, as a mode \nof punishment, is wholly and qualitatively different.  It is not like the act of killing in \nself-defence, an act justifiable in the defence of the clear right of the victim to the \npreservation of his life.  It is not performed in a state of sudden emergency, or under the \nextraordinary pressures which operate when insurrections are confronted or when the \nState defends itself during War.  It is systematically planned long after - sometimes years \nafter - the offender has committed the offence for which he is to be punished, and whilst \n\n \n \n\n155 \n\n\f \n \n\nMAHOMED J \n\nhe waits impotently in custody, for his date with the hangman.  In its obvious and \nawesome finality, it makes every other right, so vigorously and eloquently guaranteed by \nChapter  3  of  the  Constitution,  permanently  impossible  to  enjoy.    Its  inherently \nirreversible consequence, makes any reparation or correction impossible, if subsequent \nevents  establish,  as  they  have  sometimes  done,  the  innocence  of  the  executed  or \ncircumstances which demonstrate manifestly that he did not deserve the sentence of \ndeath. \n\n \n[271]  The death sentence must, in some measure, manifest a philosophy of indefensible despair in its \nexecution, accepting as it must do, that the offender it seeks to punish is so beyond the \npale of humanity as to permit of no rehabilitation, no reform, no repentance, no inherent \nspectre  of  hope  or  spirituality;  nor  the  slightest  possibility  that  he  might  one  day, \nsuccessfully and  deservedly be able to pursue and to enjoy the great rights of dignity and \nsecurity and the fundamental freedoms protected in Chapter 3 of the Constitution, the \nexercise of which is possible only if the \"right to life\" is not destroyed.  The finality of \nthe death penalty allows for none of these redeeming possibilities.  It annihilates the \npotential for their emergence.  Moreover, it cannot accomplish its objective without \ninvading in a very deep and distressing way, the guarantee of human dignity afforded by \nsection 10 of the Constitution, as the person sought to be executed spends long periods in \ncustody, anguished by the prospect of being \"hanged by the neck until he is dead\" in the \nlanguage of section 279(4) of Act 51 of 1977.  The invasion of his dignity is inherent.  \nHe is effectively told:  \"You are beyond the pale of humanity.  You are not fit to live \namong humankind.  You are not entitled to life.  You are not entitled to dignity.  You are \nnot human.  We will therefore annihilate your life\".  (See the observations of Brennan J \nin Trop v Dulles 356 US 84 at 100). \n\n \n[272]  It is not necessarily only the dignity of the person to be executed which is invaded.  Very \narguably the dignity of all of us, in a caring civilization, must be compromised, by the act \nof repeating, systematically and deliberately, albeit for a wholly different objective, what \nwe find to be so repugnant in the conduct of the offender in the first place (see Furman v \nGeorgia 408 US 238 at 273 (1972)(Brennan J, concurring)). \n\n \n \n\n156 \n\n\fMAHOMED J \n\n \n \n \n[273]  I also have very considerable difficulty in reconciling the guarantee of the right to equality \nwhich is protected by section 8 of the Constitution, with the death penalty.  I have no \ndoubt  whatever  that  Judges  seek  conscientiously  and  sedulously  to  avoid,  any \nimpermissibly unequal treatment between different accused whom they are required to \nsentence, but there is an inherent risk of arbitrariness in the process, which makes it \nimpossible to determine and predict which accused person guilty of a capital offence will \nescape the death penalty and which will  not.  The fault is not of the sentencing Court, \nbut in the process itself.  The ultimate result depends not on the predictable application \nof objective criteria, but on a vast network of variable factors which include, the poverty \nor affluence of the accused and his ability to afford experienced and skillful counsel and \nexpert testimony;  his resources in pursuing potential avenues of investigation, tracing \nand procuring witnesses and establishing facts relevant to his defence and credibility;  \nthe temperament and sometimes unarticulated but perfectly bona fide values of the \nsentencing  officer  and  their  impact  on  the  weight  to  be  attached  to  mitigating  and \naggravating factors;  the inadequacy of resources which compels the pro - deo system to \ndepend substantially on the services of mostly very conscientious but inexperienced and \nrelatively junior counsel;  the levels of literacy and communication skills of the different \naccused in effectively transmitting to counsel the nuances of fact and inference often \nvital  to  the  probabilities;    the  level  of  training  and  linguistic  facilities  of  busy \ninterpreters;  the environmental milieu of the accused and the difference between that \nand the comparative environment of those who defend, prosecute and judge him; class, \nrace, gender and age differences  which influence bona fide perceptions, relevant to the \ndetermination  of  the  ultimate  sentence;    the  energy,  skill  and  intensity  of  police \ninvestigations in a particular case;  and the forensic skills and experience of counsel for \nthe prosecution.  There are many other such factors which influence the result and which \ndetermine who gets executed and who survives.  The result is not susceptible to objective \nprediction.  Some measure of arbitrariness seems inherent in the process.  This truth has \ncaused Blackmun J, one of the most experienced Judges of the United States Supreme \nCourt, finally to conclude that it \n\n \n \n \n\n157 \n\n\f \n \n\nMAHOMED J \n\"is  virtually  self-evident  to  me  now  that  no  combination  of  procedural  rules  or \nsubstantive regulations ever can save the death penalty from its inherent constitutional \ndeficiencies.  The basic question - does the system accurately and consistently determine \nwhich defendants 'deserve' to die? - cannot be answered in the affirmative\" (Callins v \nCollins 114 S. Ct. 1127; 127 L.Ed.2d 435 (1994)(Blackmun J, dissenting)). \n\n \n \n[274]  It  must,  of  course,  be  conceded  that  the  factors  which  ensure  arbitrariness  in  the  judicial \napplication of the death sentence, must in some considerable measure also influence a \nsentence  of  imprisonment,  but  there  is  an  enormous  difference  between  the  death \nsentence and imprisonment or any other sentence.  It is  a qualitative and not just a \nquantitative difference.  The unfair consequences of a wrong sentence of imprisonment \ncan  be  reversed.    Death,  however,  is  final  and  irreversible.    The  accused,  who  is \nimprisoned,  is  still  able  to  exercise,  within  the  discipline  of  the  prison,  in  varying \ndegrees, some of the other rights which the Constitution guarantees to every person.  The \nexecuted prisoner loses the right to pursue any other right.  He simply dies. \n\n \n[275]  For substantially the reasons given by Chaskalson P, I am further of the view that the death \npenalty is also inconsistent with section 11(2) of the Constitution which provides that: \n\n \n\n\"No  person  shall  be  subject  to  torture  of  any  kind,  whether  physical,  mental  or \nemotional, nor shall any person be subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or \npunishment.\" \n\n \n \n[276]  The different parts of section 11(2) must be read disjunctively.  The death sentence would \n\n(subject to section 33) offend section 11(2) if it constitutes \n\n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n(g) \n\ntorture;  or \ncruel treatment;  or \ncruel punishment;  or \ninhuman treatment;  or \ninhuman punishment;  or \ndegrading treatment;  or \ndegrading punishment. \n\n(See Ex Parte Attorney-General, Namibia:  In re Corporal Punishment 1991 (3) SA 76 \n(NmSC) at 86B-D) \n\n158 \n\n \n \n\n\f \n \n \n[277]  In my view, the death sentence does indeed constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment \n\nMAHOMED J \n\nwithin the meaning of those expressions in section 11(2). \n\n \n[278]  Undoubtedly, this conclusion does involve in some measure a value judgment, but it is a value \njudgment which requires objectively to be formulated, having regard to the ordinary \nmeaning  of  the  words  used  in  section  11(2);    its  consistency  with  the  other  rights \nprotected by the Constitution and the constitutional philosophy and humanism expressed \nboth  in  the  preamble  and  the  postamble  to  the  Constitution;    its  harmony  with  the \nnational  ethos  which  the  Constitution  identifies;    the  historical  background  to  the \nstructures and objectives of the Constitution;  the discipline of proportionality to which it \nmust  legitimately  be  subject;    the  effect  of  the  death  sentence  on  the  right  to  life \nprotected by the Constitution;  its inherent arbitrariness in application;  its impact on \nhuman dignity;  and its consistency with constitutional perceptions evolving both within \nSouth Africa and the world outside with which our country shares emerging values \ncentral  to  the  permissible  limits  and  objectives  of  punishment  in    the  civilized \ncommunity. \n\n \n[279]  I have dealt with some of these issues, in analysing the proper approach to the interpretation of \nthe Constitution, and in focusing on the rights protected by sections 8, 9 and 10 of the \nConstitution.  Some of the  other issues relevant to the exercise, have been dealt with in \nthe comprehensive judgment of the President and the persuasive comments of some of \nmy colleagues. \n\n \n[280]  Applying the relevant considerations which emerge from the proper approach in assessing \nwhether capital punishment  is \"cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment\", I share the \nconclusions arrived at by the United Nations Committee on Human Rights, and the \nHungarian Constitutional Court, (Decision 23/1990 (X31) AB) that the death sentence is \ncruel and degrading punishment and the conclusion of the Californian Supreme Court \nthat it is \"impermissibly cruel\" (People v Anderson 493 P.2d 880 (1972)).  \n\n \n \n \n\n159 \n\n\fMAHOMED J \n\n \n \n[281]  In my view, it also constitutes inhuman punishment.  It invades irreversibly the humanity of the \noffender by annihilating the minimum content of the right to life protected by section 9;  \nby  degrading  impermissibly  the  humanity  inherent  in  his  right  to  dignity;    by  the \ninevitable arbitrariness with which its objective is implemented; by the continuing and \ncorrosive denigration of his humanity in the long periods preceding his formal execution; \n by the inescapable denial of his humanity inherently involved in a sentence which \ndirects his elimination from society.  \n\n \n[282]  I am accordingly of the view that the death penalty does prima facie invade the right to life; the \nright  to equality; the right to dignity; and the right not to be subject to cruel inhuman or \ndegrading  punishment,  respectively  protected  by  sections  9,  8,  10  and  11(2)  of  the \nConstitution. \n\n \n[283]  Notwithstanding that conclusion however, it would be our duty to uphold the constitutionality of \nthe death penalty if it was saved by section 33 of the Constitution, which provides that \nthe rights entrenched by Chapter 3 may be limited by a law of general application, \nprovided that such limitation \n\n \n\n \n \n\nshall be permissible only to the extent that it is \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nreasonable; and \njustifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom and \nequality; and \n\nshall not negate the essential content of the right in question, \n\nand provided that any limitation to \n\na right entrenched in section 10, 11, 12, 14(1), 21, 25 or 30(1)(d) or (e) or (2); \nor \n......... \n\n \n\nshall in addition to being reasonable as required in paragraph (a)(i) also be necessary\". \n\n\"(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(aa) \n\n(bb) \n\nOn a proper construction of section 33, a \"law of general application\" which invades a \nright entrenched in Chapter 3, will be declared unconstitutional unless the party relying \non such law is able to establish that it fulfils each of the conditions prescribed by this \nsection, for its justification. \n\n \n[284]  In order to qualify as a permissible limitation in terms of section 33 the State must therefore \n \n \n\n160 \n\n\f \n \n\nMAHOMED J \n\nestablish that the invasions on the right to life,  the right to be protected from unfair \ndiscrimination,  the right to dignity and the right to be  protected from cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading punishment, which the application of the death penalty causes, satisfy at least \nthe three separate elements specified in sections 33(1)(a)(i), (ii) and 33(1)(b).  In the case \nof a limitation on the right to dignity and the right to be protected from cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading punishment, the fourth element of \"necessity\" contained in section 33(1)(aa) \nmust further be satisfied. \n\n \n[285]  The most plausible argument in support of the submission that the death penalty does satisfy \nthese onerous conditions prescribed by section 33 is the submission that it acts as a \ndeterrent.  That argument has dominated perceptions in support of the death penalty, both \nin South Africa and abroad. \n\n \n[286]  It must readily be conceded that if it could be established that the death sentence does indeed \ndeter the commission of serious offences in respect of which the death penalty is a \ncompetent  sentence,  it  would  indeed  be  a  very  relevant  and  at  least  a  potentially \npersuasive consideration in support of its justification in terms of section 33.  There are, \nhowever, some serious difficulties involved in the acceptance of the proposition that the \ndeath penalty is, or ever has been, a demonstrable deterrence. \n\n \n[287]  The legitimacy of the argument must to a substantial degree be premised on an assumption \nwhich appears to me to be fallacious and at the least, highly speculative and rationally \nunconvincing.  That assumption is that a criminal, contemplating the commission of a \nserious offence, weighs the risk that he might be sentenced to death against the risk that \nhe might not be sentenced to death but only to a long term of imprisonment of twenty \nyears or more.  The assumption is that he would decide to commit the offence even at the \nrisk of receiving a long term of imprisonment but that if the death sentence was the risk, \nhe would refrain from committing the offence at all.  I have serious difficulties with \nthese assumptions.  In the first place they are not supported by any empirical evidence or \nresearch in this country or abroad.  Secondly, this argument attributes to the offender a \ncapacity for reflection and contemplation and a maturity of analysis which appears to me \n\n \n \n\n161 \n\n\f \n \n\nMAHOMED J \n\nto be unrealistic.  Thirdly, and more fundamentally, it ignores what is possibly the real \nfactor in any risk assessment which might activate a potentially serious offender:  the \nrisk which he considers is that he will not be caught.  If he believed that there was a real \nrisk of being apprehended, charged and convicted he would not willingly assume the \nprospect of many years of quite punishing imprisonment. \n\n \n[288]  If, as I believe, such offenders  commit the crimes contemplated because of a belief that they \nwill probably not be apprehended at all, it is a belief which is regrettably justified.  On \nthe information that was common cause in argument before us, sixty or seventy percent \nof offenders who commit serious crimes are not apprehended at all and a substantial \nproportion of those who are, are never convicted.  The risk is therefore worth taking, not \nbecause the death penalty would, in the perception of the offender, not be imposed but \nbecause no punishment is likely to result at all.  The levels of serious crimes committed \nin South Africa are indeed disturbing.  For many in the community, life has become \ndangerous and intolerable.  Criminals do need vigorously to be deterred from conduct \nwhich endangers the security and freedom of citizens to a very distressing degree but, on \nthe available evidence, it is facile to assume that the retention of the death penalty will \nprovide the deterrence which is clearly needed.  I have analysed such statistics as were \ndebated in argument.  In comparisons between States in the United States of America \nwhich retained the death penalty and those which did not, there is no manifest proof that \nthe  rate  of  serious  crime  was  greater  in  the  States  which  did  not  sanction  capital \npunishment.  In the case of those which did abolish capital punishment, there was no \nconvincing proof that the rate of serious crime was greater after such act of abolition \n(Peterson and Bailey, \"Murder and Capital Punishment in the context of the Post-\nFurman Era (1988)66 Social Forces 774;  Thorsten Sellin, The Death Penalty, 1982). \n\n \n[289]  Following a survey of research findings the United Nations concluded that - \n \n\n\"this  research  has  failed  to  provide  scientific  proof  that  executions  have  a  greater \ndeterrent effect than life imprisonment - such proof is unlikely to be following.  The \nevidence as a whole still gives no possible support to the deterrent hypothesis\". (United \nNations:  The Question of the Death Penalty and the New Contributions of Criminal \nScience to the Matter (1988) at 110). \n\n162 \n\n \n \n\n\fMAHOMED J \n\n \n \n \n \n[290]  We were not furnished with any reliable research dealing with the relationship between the rate \nof serious offences and the proportion of successful apprehensions and convictions \nfollowing on the commission of serious offences.  This would have been a significant \nenquiry.  It appears to me to be an inherent probability that the more successful the \npolice are in solving serious crimes and the more successful they are in apprehending the \ncriminals concerned and securing their convictions, the greater will be the perception of \nrisk for those contemplating such offences.  That increase in the perception of risk, \ncontemplated by the offender, would bear a relationship to the rate at which serious \noffences are committed.  Successful arrest and conviction must operate as a deterrent and \nthe State should, within the limits of its undoubtedly constrained resources, seek to deter \nserious crime by adequate remuneration for the police force; by incentives to improve \ntheir training and skill;  by augmenting their numbers in key areas;  and by facilitating \ntheir legitimacy in the perception of the communities in which they work. \n\n[291]  Successful deterrence of serious crime also involves the need for substantial redress in the socio-\neconomic conditions of those ravaged by poverty, debilitated by disease and malnutrition \nand disempowered by illiteracy.  Rapid amelioration in these areas must have some \nconcomitant effect on the levels of crime.  There has to be a corresponding campaign \namong the communities affected by serious crime to harness their own legitimacy and \ntheir own infrastructures, in interaction with the security agencies of the State.  The \npower and influence of agencies of moral authority such as teachers, school principals \nand religious leaders must rapidly be restored.  Crime is a multi-faceted phenomenon.  It \nhas to be assaulted on a multi-dimensional level to facilitate effective deterrence. \n\n \n[292]  The  moratorium on the execution of the death penalty, which has been effectively in operation \nsince 1990, is also relevant in offering some insight into the veracity of the proposition \nthat executions for capital crimes operate as a deterrent.  That proposition, as Didcott J \nhas correctly analysed, is not cogently supported by the statistics made available to us for \nthe period following upon the moratorium;  nor is it supported by the rate at which crime \nlevels increased during periods in our history when executions were administered with \n\n \n \n\n163 \n\n\f \n \n\nvigour. \n\nMAHOMED J \n\n \n[293]  Bringing to bear upon the issue, therefore, a rational and judicial judgment, I have not been \npersuaded  that  the  fear  of  the  death  penalty  rationally  or  practically  operates  as  a \ndemonstrable deterrent for offenders seeking to perpetrate serious crimes.  It remains, for \nthe reasons I have previously discussed, an impermissibly cruel invasion of rights, the \nsustenance of which is fundamental to a defensible civilization, protected in South Africa \nby the ethos of a Constitution, which is manifestly humanistic and caring in its content. \n\n \n[294]  Even if the fallacious and speculative assumptions which motivate the argument in support of \nthe proposition that the death sentence does act as a deterrent against serious crime were \nto be accepted, rationally the fear of the death penalty would only operate on the mind of \nthe potential offender if there was a serious risk that he could be so punished.  On the \ninformation made available to us, however, that risk is in any event so minimal, as to \nconstitute a remote statistical possibility, which, as Mr Trengove argued, might be no \nmore significant than the risk of dying in a motor accident. It is difficult to appreciate \nhow such a remote statistical possibility acts as a deterrent on the minds of potential \noffenders.   \n\n \n[295]  On a judicial application of all the relevant considerations and the facts made available to us, I \ntherefore  cannot  conclude  that  the  State  has  successfully  established  that  the  death \npenalty per se has any deterrent effect on the potential perpetrators of serious offences.   \n[296]  Is there any other basis on which the death penalty can be justified?  The only serious alternative \nbasis suggested in  argument was that it is justifiable as an act of retribution.  Retribution \nhas indeed constituted one of the permissible objects of criminal punishment because \nthere is an inherent legitimacy about the claim that the individual victims and society \ngenerally should, and are entitled to, enforce punishment as an expression of their moral \noutrage and sense of grievance.  I have, however, some serious difficulties with the \njustification of the death sentence as a form of retribution.  The proper approach is not to \ncontrast  the  legitimacy  of  the  death  sentence  as  a  form  of  retribution  against  no \nretribution at all.  That is plainly untenable and manifestly indefensible.  The relevant \n\n \n \n\n164 \n\n\f \n \n\nMAHOMED J \n\ncontrast is between the death sentence and the alternative of a very lengthy period of \nimprisonment, in appropriate cases.  It is difficult to appreciate why a sentence which \ncompels  the  offender  to  spend  years  and  years  in  prison,  away  from  his  family,  in \nconditions of deliberate austerity and rigid discipline, substantially and continuously \nimpeding his enjoyment of the elementary riches and gifts of civilized living, is not an \neffective and adequate expression of moral outrage.  The unarticulated fallacy  in the \nargument that it is not, is the proposition that it must indeed be equivalent in form to the \noffence committed.  That is an impermissible argument.  The burning of the house of the \noffender is not a permissible punishment for arson.  The rape of the offender is not a \npermissible punishment of a rapist.  Why should murder be a permissible punishment for \nmurder?  Indeed, there are good reasons why it should not, because its execution might \ndesensitize respect for life per se.  More crucially, within the context of the South \nAfrican Constitution, it appears to be at variance with its basic premise and ethos which I \nanalysed earlier in this judgment.  On these considerations, I find it difficult to hold that \nthe death sentence has been demonstrated by the State to be \"justifiable in an open and \ndemocratic society based on freedom and equality\".  \n\n \n[297]  That  conclusion  should  make  it  unnecessary  for  me  to  deal  with  the  other  elements  of \njustification set out in section 33, but I am in any event of the view that the  State has not \nestablished  that  the  limitations  the  death  penalty  imposes  on  the  relevant  rights  in \nChapter 3, which I have discussed, can be said to be \"necessary\".  That is a material \nelement for justification in terms of section 33 where what is limited is the right to \nhuman  dignity  in  section  10  or  the  right  to  be  protected  from  cruel,  inhuman  or \ndegrading punishment in terms of section 11(2).  The failure to satisfy that element is \nfatal to the attempt to establish justification in terms of section 33.  Section 277(1)(a) of \nAct 51 of 1977 must therefore be the constitutional casualty of this conclusion and \ntherefore  be  struck  down.    The  reasons  which  have  prompted  that  conclusion  are \nsubstantially also of application to sub-paragraphs (c) (d) (e) and (f) of section 277(1) \nand must therefore endure the same fate.  For the reasons given by Chaskalson P, I agree \nthat the issue as to whether section 277(1)(b) is unconstitutional should be left open. \n\n \n \n \n\n165 \n\n\f \n[298]  It  also  follows  from  my  approach  and  the  conclusions  to  which  I  have  arrived,  that  it  is \nunnecessary to decide whether or not the death penalty does \"negate the essential content \nof the right in question\" within the meaning of section 33(1)(b).  I also prefer to leave \nthis question open.  In the absence of full argument, I do not consider it desirable to \ndetermine what the meaning of the reference to the \"essential content of the right\" is.  \nChaskalson P, in paragraph 132 of his judgment, has, without deciding, referred to two \napproaches which he describes as the  \"objective\" and \"subjective\" determination of the \nessential content.  Arguably, it is possible to consider  a third angle which focuses on the \ndistinction between the \"essential content\" of a right and some other content.  This \ndistinction might justify a relative approach to the determination of what is the essential \ncontent of a right by distinguishing the central core of the right from its peripheral \noutgrowth and subjecting \"a law of general application\" limiting an entrenched right, to \nthe discipline of not invading the core, as distinct from the peripheral outgrowth.  In this \nregard,  there  may  conceivably  be  a  difference  between  rights  which  are  inherently \ncapable of incremental invasion and those that are not.  We have not heard proper \nargument on any of these distinctions which justify debate in the future in a proper case.  \nI say no more. \n\n \n[299]  Consistent  with  my  approach  to  the  judicial  process  involved  in  the  determination  of  the \nconstitutionality of the death sentence, I am accordingly privileged to concur in the order \nsupported by all my colleagues. \n\n \n \n[300]  MOKGORO J:  I am in agreement with the judgement of Chaskalson P, its reasoning, and its \nconclusions, and I concur in the order that gives effect to those conclusions.  I give this \nbrief concurring opinion to highlight what I regard as important:  namely that, when our \ncourts promote the underlying values of an open and democratic society in terms of \nSection 35 when considering the constitutionality of laws, they should recognise that \nindigenous South African values are not always irrelevant nor unrelated to this task.  In \nmy view, these values are embodied in the Constitution and they impact directly on the \ndeath penalty as a form of punishment. \n\n \n \n\n166 \n\n\f \n \n \n[301]  Now  that  constitutionalism  has  become  central  to  the  new  emerging  South  African \njurisprudence, legislative interpretation will be radically different from what it used to be \nin the past legal order.  In that legal order, due to the sovereignty of parliament, the \nsupremacy of legislation and the absence of judicial review of parliamentary statutes, \ncourts  engaged  in  simple  statutory  interpretation,  giving  effect  to  the  clear  and \nunambiguous language of the legislative text - no matter how unjust the legislative \nprovision.  The view of the court in Bongopi v Council of the State, Ciskei 1992(3) SA \n250 (CK) at 265 H - I, as per Pickard CJ is instructive in this regard: \n\n \n\n\u2018This court has always stated openly that it is not the maker of laws.  It will \nenforce the law as it finds it.  To attempt to promote policies that are not to be \nfound in the law itself or to prescribe what it believes to be the current public \nattitudes or standards in regard to these policies is not its function\u2019. \n\n \n \n[302]  With the entrenchment of a Bill of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms in a supreme constitution, \nhowever, the interpretive task frequently involves making constitutional choices by \nbalancing competing fundamental rights and freedoms. This can often only be done by \nreference to a system of values extraneous to the constitutional text itself, where these \nprinciples constitute the historical context in which the text was adopted and which help \nto explain the meaning of the text.  The constitution makes it particularly imperative for \ncourts to develop the entrenched fundamental rights in terms of a cohesive set of values, \nideal to an open and democratic society.  To this end common values of human rights \nprotection the world over and foreign precedent may be instructive. \n\n \n[303]  While it is important to appreciate that in the matter before us the court had been called upon to \ndecide an issue of constitutionality and not to engage in debate on the desirability of \nabolition or retention, it is equally important to appreciate that the nature of the court\u2019s \nrole in constitutional interpretation, and the duty placed on courts by Section 35, will of \nnecessity draw them into the realm of making necessary value choices. \n\n \n \n \n\n167 \n\n\fMOKGORO J \n\n \n \n[304]  The  application  of  the  limitation  clause  embodied  in  Section  33(1)  to  any  law  of  general \napplication which competes with a Chapter 3 right is essentially also an exercise in \nbalancing opposing rights.  To achieve the required balance will of necessity involve \nvalue judgements.  This is the nature of constitutional interpretation.  Indeed Section \n11(2) which is the counterpart of Section 15(1) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe1, and \nprovides protection against cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, embodies broad \nidealistic notions of dignity and humanity.  If applied to determine whether the death \npenalty was a form of torture, treatment or punishment which is cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading it also involves making value choices, as was held per Gubbay CJ in Catholic \nCommision for Justice and Peace, Zimbabwe v Attorney-General, Zimbabwe, 1993(4) \nSA  239(ZS)  at  241.    In  order  to  guard  against  what  Didcott  J,  in  his  concurring \njudgement terms the trap of undue subjectivity, the interpretation clause prescribes that \ncourts seek guidance in international norms and foreign judicial precedent, reflective of \nthe  values  which  underlie  an  open  and  democratic  society  based  on  freedom  and \nequality. By articulating rather than suppressing values which underlie our decisions, we \nare not being subjective. On the contrary, we set out in a transparent and objective way \nthe foundations of our interpretive choice and make them available for criticism.  Section \n35  seems  to  acknowledge  the  paucity  of  home-grown  judicial  precedent  upholding \nhuman rights, which is not surprising considering the repressive nature of the past legal \norder.  It requires courts to proceed to public international law and foreign case law for \nguidance in constitutional interpretation, thereby promoting the ideal and internationally \naccepted values in the cultivation of a human rights jurisprudence for South Africa.  \nHowever, I am of the view that our own (ideal) indigenous value systems are a premise \nfrom which we need to proceed and are not wholly unrelated to our goal of a society \nbased on freedom and equality.  This, in my view too, is the relevance of the submissions \nof Adv. Davids, appearing as amicus curiae on behalf of the Black  Advocates\u2019 Forum, \nalbeit that these submissions were inappropriately presented. \n\n \n[305]  In Dudgeon v United Kingdom (1982) 4 EHRR 149, the European Court of Human Rights, per \n                                                 \n\n     1 Act No 12 of 1979. \n\n \n \n\n168 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nWalsh J, expressed the view that: \n\nMOKGORO J \n\n\u201c... in a democracy the law cannot afford to ignore the moral consensus of the \ncommunity.  If  the  law  is  out  of  touch  with  the  moral  consensus  of  the \ncommunity, whether by being either too far below it or too far above it, the law \nis brought into contempt\u201d (at 184). \n\nAlthough this view was expressed in relation to the legislative process, in as far as courts \nhave to comply with the requirements of Section 35 of the Constitution the approach it \nembodies is not wholly inapplicable in constitutional adjudication.  Enduring values, \nhowever, are not the same as fluctuating public opinion.  In his argument before the \ncourt, the Attorney General submitted that: \n\n\u201c... the overwhelming public opinion in favour of the retention of the death \nsentence is sufficiently well-known to be accepted as the true voice of the \nSouth African society.  This opinion of the South African public is evidenced \nby  newspaper  articles,  letters  to  newspapers,  debates  in  the  media  and \nrepresentations to the authorities...\u201d \n\nThe described sources of public opinion can hardly be regarded as scientific.  Yet even if \nthey were, constitutional adjudication is quite different from the legislative process, \nbecause \u201cthe court is not a politically responsible institution\u201d2 to be seized every five \nyears by majoritarian opinion.  The values intended to be promoted by Section 35 are not \nfounded on what may well be uninformed or indeed prejudiced public opinion.  One of \nthe  functions  of  the  court  is  precisely  to  ensure  that  vulnerable  minorities  are  not \ndeprived of their constitutional rights. \n\n                                                 \n\n     2 See Jesse Choper quoted in Rights and Constitutionalism; The New South African Legal Order; Van Wyk \nD. et al, Juta, 1994 p. 9.  The suggestion is that the judiciary is not wholly removed from the political process, \nwhere it plays a supervisory role, restraining the majority will through judicial review. \n\n \n \n\n169 \n\n\fMOKGORO J \n\n \n \n[306]  In support of her main contention, Adv. Davids quite appropriately expressed concern for the \nneed to consider the value systems of the formerly marginalised sectors of society in \ncreating a South African jurisprudence.  However, for reasons outlined in the concurring \nopinion of Sachs J, the issue was regrettably not argued.  Indeed even if her submissions \nmight not have influenced the final decision of the court, the opportunity to present and \nargue properly adduced evidence of those undistorted values historically disregarded in \nSouth African judicial law-making would have created an opportunity of important \nhistorical  value,  injecting  such  values  into  the  mainstream  of  South  African \njurisprudence.  The experience would, in my view, also have served to emphasise that \nthe need to develop an all-inclusive South African jurisprudence is not only incumbent \nupon  the  judiciary,  let  alone  the  Constitutional  Court.    The  broad  legal  profession, \nacademia and those sectors of organised civil society particularly concerned with public \ninterest law, have an equally important responsibility and role to play by combining \nefforts and resources to place the required evidence in argument before the courts.  It is \nnot as if these resources are lacking; what has been absent has been the will, and the \nacknowledgment of the importance of the material concerned. \n\n \n[307]  In interpreting the Bill of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, as already mentioned, an all-\ninclusive value system, or common values in South Africa, can form a basis upon which \nto develop a South African human rights jurisprudence.  Although South Africans have a \nhistory of deep divisions characterised by strife and conflict, one shared value and ideal \nthat runs like a golden thread across cultural lines, is the value of ubuntu - a notion now \ncoming to be generally articulated in this country.  It is well accepted that the transitional \nConstitution is a culmination of a negotiated political settlement.  It is a bridge between a \nhistory of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian principles, and a future of \nreconstruction  and  reconciliation.    The  post-amble  of  the  Constitution  expressly \nprovides, \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\u201c...  there  is  a  need  for  understanding  but  not  for  vengeance,  a  need  for \nreparation but not for retaliation, a need for ubuntu but not for victimisation...\u201d \n\n170 \n\n\f \n \n\nMOKGORO J \n\nNot  only  is  the  notion  of  ubuntu  expressly  provided  for  in  the  epilogue  of  the \nConstitution, the underlying idea and its accompanying values are also expressed in the \npreamble.  These values underlie, first and foremost, the whole idea of adopting a Bill of \nFundamental  Rights  and  Freedoms  in  a  new  legal  order.    They  are  central  to  the \ncoherence of all the rights entrenched in Chapter 3 - where the right to life and the right \nto  respect  for  and  protection  of  human  dignity  are  embodied  in  Sections  9  and  10 \nrespectively. \n\n \n[308]  Generally, ubuntu translates as humaneness.  In its most fundamental sense, it translates as \npersonhood  and  morality.    Metaphorically,  it  expresses  itself  in  umuntu  ngumuntu \nngabantu, describing the significance of group solidarity on survival issues so central to \nthe survival of communities.  While it envelops the key values of group solidarity, \ncompassion, respect, human dignity, conformity to basic norms and collective unity, in \nits fundamental sense it denotes humanity and morality.  Its spirit emphasises respect for \nhuman dignity, marking a shift from confrontation to conciliation.3  In South Africa \nubuntu has become a notion with particular resonance in the building of a democracy.  It \nis  part  of  our  \u201crainbow\u201d  heritage,  though  it  might  have  operated  and  still  operates \ndifferently in diverse community settings.  In the Western cultural heritage, respect and \nthe  value  for  life,  manifested  in  the  all-embracing  concepts  of  humanity  and \nmenswaardigheid are also highly priced.  It is values like these that Section 35 requires \nto be promoted.  They give meaning and texture to the principles of a society based on \nfreedom and equality. \n\n \n[309]  In American jurisprudence, courts have recognised that the dignity of the individual in American \nsociety is the supreme value.  Even the most evil offender, it has been held, \u201cremains a \nhuman being possessed of a common human dignity\u201d (Furman v Georgia 408 US 238 at \n273 (1972)), thereby making the calculated process of the death penalty inconsistent with \nthis basic, fundamental value.  In Hungarian jurisprudence, the right to life and the right \n\n                                                 \n\n     3 Mbigi, L., with J. Maree, UBUNTU - The Spirit of African Transformation Management, Knowledge \nResources, 1995, pp. 1-16. \n\n \n \n\n171 \n\n\f \n \n\nMOKGORO J \n\nto human dignity are protected as twin rights in Section 54(1) of that Constitution4.  They \nare viewed as an inseparable unity of rights.  Not only are they regarded as a unity of \nindivisible  rights,  but  they  also  have  been  held  to  be  the  genesis  of  all  rights.    In \ninternational law, on the other hand, human dignity is generally considered the fountain \nof all rights.  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) G.A. Res \n2200 (XXI), 21 U.N. GAOR, SUPP. (No, 16) at 52, U.N. DOC. A/6316(1966), in its \npreamble, makes references to \u201cthe inherent dignity of all members of the human family\u201d \nand concludes that \u201chuman rights derive from the inherent dignity of the human person\u201d. \n This, in my view, is not different from what the spirit of ubuntu embraces. \n\n \n[310]  It is common cause, however, that the legal system in South Africa, and the socio-political \nsystem within which it operated, has for decades traumatised the human spirit.  In many \nways, it trampled on the basic humanity of citizens.  We cannot in all conscience declare, \nas did a United States Supreme Court justice in Furman v Georgia 408 US 238, at 296 \n(1972) with reference to the American context, that respect for and protection of human \ndignity has been a central value in South African jurisprudence. We cannot view the \ndeath penalty as fundamentally inconsistent with our harsh legal heritage.  Indeed, it was \nan integral part of a system of law enforcement that imposed severe penalties on those \nwho aspired to achieve the values enshrined in our Constitution today. \n\n \n[311]  South Africa now has a new constitution however, which creates a constitutional state.  This \nstate is in turn founded on the recognition and protection of basic human rights, and \nalthough this constitutes a revolutionary change in legal terms, the idea is consistent with \nthe inherited traditional value systems of South Africans in general - traditional values \nwhich hardly found the chance to bring South Africa on par with the rest of the world.  \n\n                                                 \n\n     4 See analysis in the English translation of Decision No 23/1990 (X31) AB of the Hungarian Constitutional \nCourt. \n\n \n \n\n172 \n\n\fMOKGORO J \n\nAs this constitution evolves to overcome the culture of gross human rights violations of \nthe past, jurisprudence in South Africa will simultaneously develop a culture of respect \nfor and protection of basic human rights.  Central to this commitment is the need to \nrevive the value of human dignity in South Africa, and in turn re-define and recognise \nthe right to and protection of human dignity as a right concomitant to life itself and \ninherent in all human beings, so that South Africans may also appreciate that \u201ceven the \nvilest criminal remains a human being\u201d(Furman v Georgia, supra).  In my view, life and \ndignity are like two sides of the same coin.  The concept of ubuntu embodies them both. \n[312]  In the past legal order, basic human rights in South Africa, including the right to life and human \ndignity, were not protected in a Bill of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, in a supreme \nconstitution, as is the case today.  Parliament then was sovereign, and could pass any law \nit deemed fit.  Legislation was supreme, and due to the absence of judicial review, no \ncourt  of  law  could  set  aside  any  statute  or  its  provision  on  grounds  of  violating \nfundamental rights.  Hence, Section 277 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 51 of 1977, \ncould survive untested to this day.  \n\n \n[313]  Our new Constitution, unlike its dictatorial predecessor, is value-based.  Among other things, it \nguarantees the protection of basic human rights, including the right to life and human \ndignity, two basic values supported by the spirit of ubuntu and protected in Sections 9 \nand 10 respectively.  In terms of Section 35, this Constitution now commits the state to \nbase  the  worth  of  human  beings  on  the  ideal  values  espoused  by  open  democratic \nsocieties the world over and not on race colour, political, economic and social class.  \nAlthough it has been argued that the currently high level of crime in the country is \nindicative of the breakdown of the moral fabric of society, it has not been conclusively \nshown  that  the  death  penalty,  which  is  an  affront  to  these  basic  values,  is  the  best \navailable practical form of punishment to reconstruct that moral fabric.  In the second \nplace, even if the end was desirable, that would not justify the means. The death penalty \nviolates  the  essential  content  of  the  right  to  life  embodied  in  Section  9,  in  that  it \nextinguishes life itself.  It instrumentalises the offender for the objectives of state policy. \n That  is  dehumanising.    It  is  degrading  and it violates the rights to respect for and \nprotection of human dignity embodied in Section 10 of the Constitution. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n173 \n\n\fMOKGORO J \n\n \n \n \n[314]  Once the life of a human being is taken in the deliberate and calculated fashion that characterises \nthe described methods of execution the world over, it constitutes the ultimate cruelty \nwith  which  any  living  creature  could  ever  be  treated.    This  extreme  level  of  cruel \ntreatment of a human being, however despicably such person might have treated another \nhuman being, is still inherently cruel. It is inhuman and degrading to the humanity of the \nindividual, as well as to the humanity of those who carry it out. \n\n \n[315]  Taking the life of a human being will always be reprehensible.  Those citizens who kill deserve \nthe  most  severe  punishment,  if  it  deters  and  rehabilitates  and  therefore  effectively \naddresses deviance of this nature.  Punishment by death cannot achieve these objectives. \n The high rate of crime in this country is indeed disturbing and the state has a duty to \nprotect the lives of all citizens - including those who kill.  However, it should find more \nhumane  and  effective  integrated  approaches  to  manage  its  penal  system,  and  to \nrehabilitate offenders. \n\n \n[316]  The state is representative of its people and in many ways sets the standard for moral values \nwithin society.  If it sanctions by law punishment for killing by killing, it sanctions \nvengeance by law.  If it does so with a view to deterring others, it dehumanises the \nperson and objectifies him or her as a tool for crime control.  This objectification through \nthe calculated killing of a human being, to serve state objectives, strips the offender of \nhis or her human dignity and dehumanises, such a person constituting a violation of \nSection 10 of the Constitution. \n\n \n[317]  Although the Attorney General placed great reliance on the deterrent nature of the death penalty \nin his argument, it was conceded that this has not been conclusively proven.  It has also \nnot  been  shown  that  this  form  of  punishment  was  the  best  available  option  for  the \nrehabilitation of the offender.  Retaining the death penalty for this purpose is therefore \nunnecessary.    Section  277(1)  which  authorises  the  death  penalty  under  these \nunnecessarily inhuman and degrading circumstances is inconsistent with the right to life \nand human dignity embodied in Sections 9 and 10 of the Constitution, respectively, and \n\n \n \n\n174 \n\n\f \n\nis in direct conflict with the values that Section 35 aims to promote in the interpretation \nof these sections.  Taking the life of a person under such deliberate and calculated \ncircumstances, with the methods already described in the judgement of Chaskalson P, is \ncruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  It is inconsistent with Section \n11(2) of the Constitution.  In my view, therefore, the death penalty is unconstitutional.  \nNot  only  does  it  violate  the  right  not  be  subjected  to  cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading \ntreatment or punishment, it also violates the right to life and human dignity. \n\n \n[318]  O'REGAN J:  I have read the judgment of Chaskalson P and I agree with the order that he \nproposes. However, although I agree that the death sentence constitutes a breach of \nsection 11(2) of the Constitution that is not justified in terms of section 33, it is my view \nthat it also constitutes a breach of section 9 (the right to life) and section 10 (the right to \ndignity) for the reasons that are given in this judgment. \n\n \n[319]  The crimes of which the two prisoners whose case has been referred to this court have been \nconvicted were committed during a robbery from a bank security vehicle which was \ndelivering monthly wages to the Coronation Hospital in Johannesburg.  It appears from \nthe judgment of the Appellate Division that the two prisoners were part of a group of \nrobbers who had cold-bloodedly planned the robbery.  All the robbers had been armed \nwith AK-47s and had opened fire on the security vehicle and the accompanying vehicle \nwhen they had driven into the hospital parking area. As a result of the shooting, two \npolicemen and two bank security officials were shot dead. \n\n \n[320]  There is no doubt that the crimes committed by the two prisoners were abhorrent. Our society \ncannot and does not condone brutal murder or robbery.  Perpetrators of crimes such as \nthese must be punished severely according to our system of criminal justice.  In this case, \nthe prisoners have been tried, convicted and sentenced.  The question that this court must \nanswer is not whether the prisoners committed these crimes, nor whether they should be \npunished.  It has been established by the proper courts that they did commit crimes, and \nfor that they must be punished.  What this court must consider is whether the form of \npunishment that has been imposed is constitutional. Does our constitution permit any \n\n \n \n\n175 \n\n\f \n \n\nO\u2019REGAN J \nconvicted criminal, however heinous the crime, to be put to death by the government as \npunishment for that crime? \n\n \n\n \n[321]  The Constitution entrenches certain fundamental rights. Included amongst these are the right to \nlife (section 9), the right to the respect for and protection of dignity (section 10) and the \nright not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment (section 11(2)). The \nprisoners allege that the death penalty is in conflict with each of these.  The language of \neach of these rights is broad and capable of different interpretations.  How is this court to \ndetermine  the  content  and  scope  of  these  rights?  This  question  is  at  least  partially \nanswered by section 35(1) of the constitution which enjoins this court in interpreting the \nrights contained in the Constitution to 'promote the values which underlie an open and \ndemocratic society based on freedom and equality'. \n\n \n[322]  No-one could miss the significance of the hermeneutic standard set.  The values urged upon the \ncourt are not those that have informed our past. Our history is one of repression not \nfreedom, oligarchy not democracy, apartheid and prejudice not equality, clandestine not \nopen government.  As the epilogue to the constitution states:  \n\n \n\n`This constitution provides a historic bridge between the past of a deeply divided society \ncharacterised by strife, conflict, untold suffering and injustice, and a future founded on \nthe recognition of human rights, democracy and peaceful co-existence and development \nopportunities for all South Africans, irrespective of colour, race, class, belief or sex.' \n\n \n[323]  In interpreting the rights enshrined in chapter 3, therefore, the court is directed to the future: to \nthe ideal of a new society which is to be built on the common values which made a \npolitical transition possible in our country and which are the foundation of its new \nconstitution.  This is not to say that there is nothing from our past which should be \nretained.  Of course this is not so.  As Kentridge AJ described in the first judgment of \nthis court(S v Zuma unreported judgment of this court, 5 April 1995), many of the rights \nentrenched in section 25 of the constitution concerning criminal justice are longstanding \nprinciples of our law, although eroded by statute and judicial decision.  In interpreting \nthe rights contained in section 25, those common law principles will be useful guides.  \n\n \n \n\n176 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nO\u2019REGAN J \n\nBut generally section 35(1) instructs us, in interpreting the constitution, to look forward \nnot  backward,  to  recognise  the  evils  and  injustices  of  the  past  and  to  avoid  their \nrepetition.  \n\n \n[324]  Section 9 of the Constitution provides that: \n \n\n'Every person shall have the right to life.' \n\n \n\nThis formulation of the right to life is not one which has been used in the constitutions of \nother  countries  or  in  international  human  rights  conventions.    In  choosing  this \nformulation, the drafters have specifically avoided either expressly preserving the death \npenalty, or expressly outlawing it.  In addition, they have not used the language so \ncommon in other constitutions, which provides that no-one may be deprived of life \narbitrarily or without due process of law.1  To the extent that the formulation of the right \nis different from that adopted in other jurisdictions, their jurisprudence will be of less \nvalue. The question is thus left for us to determine whether this right, or any of the others \nenshrined in chapter 3, would prima facie prohibit the death penalty. \n\n \n[325]  In giving meaning to section 9, we must seek the purpose for which it was included in the \n\n                                                 \n\n     1 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights contains an unconditional form of the right: article 3 provides \nthat `Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person.' On the other hand, many other \ninternational rights instruments contain qualified protections of the right to life. Article 6(1) of the International \nConvention on Civil and Political Rights stipulates that `Every human being has the inherent right to life. This \nright shall be protected by law. No-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.' Subsections 2 - 5 of article 6 then \nprovide for minimum standards for countries which have not abolished the death penalty, and article 6(6) \nprovides that: `Nothing in this article shall be invoked to delay or prevent the abolition of capital punishment by \nany state party to the present covenant.' In addition in 1989 an optional protocol was adopted by the General \nAssembly of the United Nations, article 1 of which provides that `No-one within the jurisdiction of state parties \nto the present optional protocol shall be executed'. \n\nArticle 4 of the Banjul Charter on Human and People's Rights (African Charter) provides that `Human \nbeings are inviolable. Every human being shall be entitled to respect for his life and the integrity of the person. \nNo one may be arbitrarily deprived of this right.' \n\nArticle 2(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights provides that ` Everyone's right to life shall \n\nbe protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a \ncourt following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.' But in 1983 a protocol to the \nConvention was adopted which provided that capital punishment should be abolished. The protocol has been \nwidely ratified. See Van Dijk and Van Hoof Theory and Practice of the European Convention on Human Rights \n2nd ed (1990) pp 502 -3. \n\n \n \n\n177 \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nO\u2019REGAN J \n\nConstitution.2 This purposive or teleological approach to the interpretation of rights may \nat  times  require  a  generous  meaning  to  be  given  to  provisions  of  chapter  3  of  the \nConstitution, and at other times a narrower or specific meaning.  It is the responsibility \nof the courts, and ultimately this court, to develop fully the rights entrenched in the \nConstitution. But that will take time.  Consequently any minimum content which is \nattributed to a right may in subsequent cases be expanded and developed.  \n\n \n[326]  The right to life is, in one sense, antecedent to all the other rights in the Constitution.  Without \nlife in the sense of existence, it would not be possible to exercise rights or to be the \nbearer of them.  But the right to life was included in the Constitution not simply to \nenshrine the right to existence.  It is not life as mere organic matter that the Constitution \ncherishes, but the right to human life: the right to live as a human being, to be part of a \nbroader community, to share in the experience of humanity.  This concept of human life \nis at the centre of our constitutional values.  The constitution seeks to establish a society \nwhere  the  individual  value  of  each  member  of  the  community  is  recognised  and \ntreasured. The right to life is central to such a society. \n\n \n[327]  The right to life, thus understood, incorporates the right to dignity.  So the rights to human \ndignity and life are entwined.  The right to life is more than existence, it is a right to be \ntreated  as  a  human  being  with  dignity:  without  dignity,  human  life  is  substantially \ndiminished. Without life, there cannot be dignity.  This was recognised by the Hungarian \nconstitutional court in the case in which it considered the constitutionality of the death \n\n                                                 \n\n     2 See S v Zuma (unreported judgment of the Constitutional Court, 5 April 1995) para 15 in which Kentridge \nAJ referred to the judgment of Dickson J in R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd (1985) 18 DLR (4th) 321 at 395 - 6 with \napproval.

Human dignity is a naturally \naccompanying quality of human life.' (Decision No 23/1990, (X.31.) AB, George Feher \ntranslation) \n\n \n[328]  The right to dignity is enshrined in our Constitution in section 10: \n \n\n`Every person shall have the right to respect for and protection of his \nor her dignity'. \n\nThe  importance  of  dignity  as  a  founding  value  of  the  new  Constitution  cannot  be \noveremphasised.  Recognising a right to dignity is an acknowledgement of the intrinsic \nworth of human beings: human beings are entitled to be treated as worthy of respect and \nconcern.3  This right therefore is the foundation of many of the other rights that are \nspecifically entrenched in chapter 3.  As Brennan J held when speaking of forms of cruel \nand unusual punishments in the context of the American constitution: \n\n \n\n \n\n`The true significance of these punishments is that they treat members of the human race \nas non-humans, as objects to be toyed with and discarded. They are thus inconsistent \nwith the fundamental premise of the Clause that even the vilest criminal remains a \nhuman being possessed of common human dignity.' (Furman v Georgia 408 US 238 at \n272,3 (1972)) \n\n \n[329]  Respect for the dignity of all human beings is particularly important in South Africa.  For \napartheid was a denial of a common humanity.  Black people were refused respect and \ndignity  and  thereby  the  dignity  of  all  South  Africans  was  diminished.  The  new \nconstitution rejects this past and affirms the equal worth of all South Africans. Thus \nrecognition and protection of human dignity is the touchstone of the new political order \nand is fundamental to the new constitution.  \n\n \n                                                 \n\n     3See, for discussion of the right to dignity and the death penalty, the judgment of Solyom J in the Hungarian \ncase concerning the constitutionality of the death penalty (Decision no 23/1990 (X.31.) AB, George Feher \ntranslation). \n\n \n \n\n179 \n\n\f \n\n \n \n[330]  But human dignity is important to all democracies. In an aphorism coined by Ronald Dworkin \n`Because we honour dignity, we demand democracy'.4  Its importance was recognised \ntoo by Cory J in Kindler v Canada (1992) 6 CRR (2nd) 193 (SCC) at 237 in which he \nheld that `[i]t is the dignity and importance of the individual which is the essence and the \ncornerstone of democratic government'.5  \n\nO\u2019REGAN J \n\n \n[331]  The Attorney-General argued that the prisoners, and others like them, who are convicted of \ncrimes for which the death penalty is currently competent, have forfeited their right to \nlife and dignity.  This cannot be correct.  It is a fundamental premise of our constitution \nthat the rights in chapter 3 are available to all South Africans no matter how atrocious \ntheir conduct.  As Gubbay CJ held in Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, \nZimbabwe v Attorney-General, Zimbabwe 1993 (4) SA 239 (ZS) at 247 g -h: \n\n \n\n`It  cannot  be  doubted  that  prison  walls  do  not  keep  out  fundamental  rights  and \nprotections. Prisoners are not, by mere reason of a conviction, denuded of all the rights \nthey otherwise possess. No matter the magnitude of the crime, they are not reduced to \nnon-persons. They retain all basic rights, save those inevitably removed from them by \nlaw, expressly or by implication.' \n\n \n[332]  It must be emphasised that the entrenchment of a Bill of Rights, enforceable by a judiciary, is \ndesigned, in part, to protect those who are the marginalised, the dispossessed and the \noutcasts of our society.  They are the test of our commitment to a common humanity and \ncannot be excluded from it. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n     4See Ronald Dworkin Life's Dominion: An argument about abortion and euthanasia (1993) at 239. \n\n     5 See also S v Ncube 1988 (2) SA 702 (ZS) at 717 B - D. \n\n \n \n\n180 \n\n\f \n\nO\u2019REGAN J \n\n \n \n[333]  Are the rights to life and dignity breached by the death penalty?  The death sentence has been \npart of South African law since the colonial era. Not only has the law permitted the death \nsentence, but it has been regularly imposed by courts and carried out by the government. \n For many years, South Africa had the doubtful honour of being a world leader in the \nnumber of judicial executions carried out. Although there is some uncertainty about the \nstatistics,  it  appears  that  between  1981  and  1990  approximately  1100  people  were \nexecuted in South Africa, including the Transkei, Ciskei, Bophuthatswana and Venda.6  \nThe death sentence was imposed sometimes for crimes that were motivated by political \nideals.  In this way the death penalty came to be seen by some as part of the repressive \nmachinery of the former government.  Towards the end of the 1980s there were several \nmajor  public  campaigns  to  halt  the  execution  of  people  who  were  perceived  to  be \npolitical  opponents  of  the  government.    There  is  no  doubt  that  these  campaigns  to \nprevent the execution of amongst others, the 'Sharpeville Six' and the 'Upington 26' were \npartly responsible for the government's decision in 1990 to suspend the implementation \nof sentences of death. \n\n \n[334]  The purpose of the death penalty is to kill convicted criminals.  Its very purpose lies in the \ndeprivation of existence. Its inevitable result is the denial of human life.  It is hard to see \nhow this methodical and deliberate destruction of life by the government can be anything \nother than a breach of the right to life.  \n\n \n[335]  The implementation of the death penalty is also a denial of the individual's right to dignity.  The \n\nexecution of the death penalty was described by Professor Chris Barnard as follows: \n\n \n\n`The man's spinal cord will rupture at the point where it enters the skull, electrochemical \ndischarges will send his limbs flailing in a grotesque dance, eyes and tongue will start \nfrom the facial apertures under the assault of the rope and his bowels and bladder may \nsimultaneously void themselves to soil the legs and drip on the floor....'  (Rand Daily \nMail 12 June 1978, cited in Appellants' heads) \n\n                                                \n\n \n\n     6 See Murray `Hangings in Southern Africa: The last ten years' (1990) 6 SAJHR 439 - 441; Keightley \n`Hangings in Southern Africa: the last ten years' (1991) 7 SAJHR 347 - 349; `The Death Penalty in SA: \nStatistics' (1989) 2 SACJ 251; Amnesty International `When the State Kills... The Death Penalty vs Human \nRights' (1989) 204 - 207. \n\n \n \n\n181 \n\n\f \n \n \n\n \n\nO\u2019REGAN J \n\nThis frank description of the execution process leaves little doubt that it is one which is \ndestructive of human dignity. As Cory J held in Kindler v Canada (1992) 6 CRR (2nd) \n193 (SCC) at 241: \n\n`The death penalty not only deprives the prisoner of all vestiges of human dignity, it is \nthe ultimate desecration of the individual as a human being. It is the annihilation of the \nvery essence of human dignity.' \n\n \n[336]  But it is not only the manner of execution which is destructive of dignity, the circumstances in \nwhich convicted criminals await the execution of their sentence also constitutes a breach \nof dignity.  These circumstances have been amply and aptly described by Gubbay CJ in \nCatholic Commission for Justice and Peace, Zimbabwe v Attorney-General, Zimbabwe \n1993(4) SA 239 (ZS) at 268-9. Although little evidence has been placed before us to \ndescribe  the  experience  of  condemned  prisoners  in  South  Africa,  it  seems  all  too \nprobable  that  it  resembles  the  conditions  described  by  Gubbay  CJ.    Indeed,  the \nmoratorium on the implementation of the death sentence described by Chaskalson P has \nprobably aggravated the conditions of condemned prisoners considerably. \n\n \n[337]  Section 277 of the Criminal Procedure Act is therefore not only a breach of section 11(2) of the \nConstitution as held by Chaskalson P, but it is also a breach of section 9 (the right to life) \nand section 10 (the right to dignity).  It is unnecessary and would be inappropriate to \nconsider the further scope of these rights.  \n\n \n[338]  The Constitution does recognise in section 33 that the rights it entrenches may be limited by law \nof general application if a law is reasonable and justifiable (and in some circumstances, \nnecessary) in an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality.  The \ninfringement of the rights to life and dignity occasioned by section 277 of the Criminal \nProcedure Act needs to be measured against this test.  In this regard, it should be noted \nthat  a  law  which  infringes  the  right  to  dignity  must  be  shown  to  be  a  reasonable, \njustifiable and necessary limitation, whereas a law which contains a limitation upon the \nright to life need only be shown to be reasonable and justifiable.  \n\n \n \n \n\n182 \n\n\f \n\nO\u2019REGAN J \n\n \n \n[339]  The purpose of the bifurcated levels of justification need not detain us here.  What is clear is that \nsection 33 introduces different levels of scrutiny for laws which cause an infringement of \nrights.  The requirement of reasonableness and justifiability which attaches to some of \nthe section 33 rights clearly envisages a less stringent constitutional standard than does \nthe requirement of necessity.  In both cases, the enquiry concerns proportionality: to \nmeasure the purpose, effects and importance of the infringing legislation against the \ninfringement caused.  In addition, it will need to be shown that the ends sought by the \nlegislation cannot be achieved sufficiently and realistically by other means which would \nbe less destructive of entrenched rights. Where the constitutional standard is necessity, \nthe considerations are similar, but the standard is more stringent. \n\n \n[340]  In determining whether the breaches of sections 9 and 10 are justified in terms of section 33, the \nrelevant considerations are the same as those traversed by Chaskalson P at paragraphs \n116 - 131 of his judgment albeit only in the context of a breach of section 11(2).  The \nAttorney-General  argued  that  the  purpose  of  section  277  was  the  deterrence  and \nprevention  of  crime,  and  retribution.  Although  deterrence  is  an  important  goal,  as \nChaskalson P has described, the deterrent effect of the death penalty remains unproven, \nperhaps unprovable.  \n\n \n[341]  The  question  of  retribution  is  a  more  complex  one.    I  agree  with  Chaskalson  P  that  in  a \ndemocratic society retribution as a goal of punishment should not be given undue weight. \nIndeed, I am unconvinced that, where the punishment is held to constitute a breach of a \nfundamental  right,  retribution  would  ever,  on  its  own,  be  a  sufficient  ground  for \njustification.  As Marshall J noted in Furman v Georgia 408 US 238 at 344-5 (1972): \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n`To  preserve  the  integrity  of  the  Eighth  Amendment,  the  Court  has  consistently \ndenigrated retribution as a permissible goal of punishment. It is undoubtedly correct that \nthere is a demand for vengeance on the part of many persons in a community against one \nwho is convicted of a particularly offensive act. At times a cry is heard that morality \nrequires  vengeance  to  evidence  society's  abhorrence  of  the  act.  But  the  Eighth \nAmendment is our insulation from our baser selves. The `cruel and unusual' language \nlimits the avenues through which vengeance can be channelled. Were this not so, the \nlanguage would be empty and a return to the rack and other tortures would be possible in \na given case.' \n\n183 \n\n\f \n\nO\u2019REGAN J \n\n \n \n[342]  It remains then to balance the purposes of section 277 with the infringement of sections 9 and 10 \nit causes.  In this exercise, it is undeniable that sections 9 and 10 are rights which lie at \nthe heart of our constitutional framework and that section 277 grievously infringes the \nambit of these rights.  They weigh very heavily in the scales of proportionality.  On the \nother hand, while the goals of deterrence and prevention which are the purpose of section \n277 are important legislative purposes, it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that \nthey could not be sufficiently and realistically achieved by other means.  After a careful \nconsideration of the nature of the rights, the extent of the infringement of those rights, \nand  the  purposes  of  section  277,  I  remain  unpersuaded  that  section  277  is  a \nconstitutionally acceptable limitation upon the rights to life and dignity. \n\n[343]  Section  33(1)(b)  provides  that,  in  addition  to  being  reasonable  and  justifiable  (and  where \nappropriate, necessary) a limitation upon a right should not negate the essential contents \nof  the  right  in  question.    As  section  277  does  not  meet  the  requirements  of \nreasonableness,  justifiability  and  necessity,  it  is  not  necessary  and  it  would  be \ninadvisable to consider whether it negates the essential contents of the rights in question.  \n\n \n[344]  In conclusion, then, the death penalty is unconstitutional. It is a breach of the rights to life and \ndignity that are entrenched in sections 9 and 10 of our Constitution, as well as a breach \nof the prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment contained in section \n11(2).  The new Constitution stands as a monument to this society's commitment to a \nfuture in which all human beings will be accorded equal dignity and respect.  We cannot \npostpone giving effect to that commitment. \n\n \n \n[345]  SACHS J:  I agree fully with the judgment of the President of the court, and wish merely to \nelaborate on two matters,  both of emphasis rather than substance, which I feel merit \nfurther treatment.   \n\n \n\n[346]  The first relates to the balance between the right to life and the right to dignity.  The judgment \nappropriately regards the two rights as mutually re-enforcing, but places greater reliance \non the prohibition against cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment than it does on the \n\n \n \n\n184 \n\n\f \n\nright to life.  For reasons which I will outline, I think the starting-off point for an analysis \nof capital punishment should be the right to life.  \n\n \n[347]  Secondly, I think it important to say something about the source of values which, in terms of \n\nsection 35 of the Constitution, our interpretation is required to promote.  \n\n \n \n \n\nThe Right to Life and Proportionality \n\n \n[348]  Decent people throughout the world are divided over which arouses the greatest horror: the \nthought of the State  deliberately killing its citizens, or the idea of allowing cruel killers \nto co-exist with honest citizens.  For some, the fact that we cold-bloodedly kill our own \nkind, taints the whole of our society and makes us all accomplices to the premeditated \nand solemn extinction of human life.  For others, on the contrary, the disgrace is that we \nplace a higher value on the life and dignity of the killer than on that of the victim. A third \ngroup prefer a purely pragmatic approach which emphasises not the moral issues, but the \ninordinate  stress that capital punishment puts on the judicial process and, ultimately, on \nthe Presidency, as well as the morbid passions it arouses in the public;  from a purely \npractical  point  of  view,  they  argue,  capital  punishment  appears  to  offer  an  illusory \nsolution to crime, and as such actually detracts from really effective measures to protect \nthe public.   \n\n \n[349]  We are not called upon to decide between these positions.  They are essentially emotional, moral \nand pragmatic in character and will no doubt occupy the attention of the Constitutional \nAssembly.    Our  function  is  to  interpret  the  text  of  the  Constitution  as  it  stands.  \nAccordingly, whatever our personal views on this fraught subject might be, our response \nmust be a purely legal one. \n\n[350]  This court is unlikely to get another case which is emotionally and philosophically more elusive, \nand textually more direct.  Section 9 states:  \"Every person shall have the right to life.\"  \nThese unqualified and unadorned  words are binding on the State (sections 4 and 7) and, \n\n \n \n\n185 \n\n\f \n \n\non the face of it, outlaw capital punishment.  Section 33 does allow for limitations on \nfundamental rights; yet, in my view,  executing someone is not limiting that person's life, \nbut extinguishing it. \n\nSACHS J \n\n \n[351]  Life is different.  In the vivid phrase used by Mahomed J in the course of argument,  the right to \nlife is not subject to incremental invasion.  Life cannot be diminished for an hour, or a \nday, or 'for life'.  While its enjoyment can be qualified, its existence cannot.  Similarly, \ndeath is different.  It is total and irreversible.  Just, as there are no degrees of life, so \nthere are no degrees of death (though, as we shall see, there were once degrees of \nseverity in relation to how the sentence of death should be carried out). A level of \narbitrariness and the possibilities of mistake that might be inescapable and therefore \ntolerable  in  relation  to  other  forms  of  punishment,  burst  the  parameters  of \nconstitutionality when they impact on the deliberate taking of life.  The life of any \nhuman being is inevitably subject to the ultimate vagaries of the due processes of nature; \n our Constitution does not permit it to be qualified by the unavoidable caprices of the due \nprocesses of law.1  \n\n \n[352]  In the case of other constitutional rights, proportionate balances can be struck between the \nexercise of the right and permissible derogations from it.  In matters such as torture, \nwhere no derogations are allowed, thresholds of permissible and impermissible conduct \ncan  be  established.    When  it  comes  to  execution,  however,  there  is  no  scope  for \nproportionality, while the only relevant threshold is, tragically, that to eternity. \n\n \n[353]  Even if one applies an objective approach in relation to the enjoyment of the right to life, \nnamely, that the State is under a duty to create conditions to enable all persons to enjoy \n\n                                                \n\n \n\n     1The issue, of course, is whether inescapable caprice prevents the process from being 'due' when the \nconsequences are so drastic. \n\n \n \n\n186 \n\n\f \n \n\nSACHS J \n\nthe right, in my view this cannot mean that the State's function can be extended to \nencompass complete, intentional and avoidable obliteration of any person's subjective \nright.  Subject to further argument on the matter, my initial view is that the objective \napproach  can  be  used  to  qualify  the  subjective  enjoyment  of  the  right,  but  not  to \neliminate it completely, and certainly not to eliminate the subject.  It can provide the \nbasis for limiting enjoyment of other subjective rights - to dignity, personal freedom, \nmovement - for a period, or in relation to a concrete situation, or in respect of a physical \nspace,  if the requirements of section 33 are met.  Yet, life by its very nature cannot be \nrestricted, qualified, abridged, limited or derogated from in the same way.  You are either \nalive or dead.  \n\n \n[354]  In my view, section 33 permits limitations on rights, not their extinction.  Our Constitution in \nthis  sense  is  different  from  those  that  expressly authorise deprivation of life if due \nprocess  of  law  is  followed,  or  those  that  prohibit  the  arbitrary  taking  of  life.    The \nunqualified statement that 'every person has the right to life',  in effect outlaws capital \npunishment.  Instead of establishing a constitutional framework within which the State \nmay deprive citizens of their lives, as it could have done, our Constitution commits the \nState to affirming and protecting life.  Because section 33 is not concerned with creating \ncircumstances in which the right of any person may be disregarded altogether, nor with \nestablishing  exceptions  which  qualify  the  nature  of  the  right  itself,  or  exclude  its \noperation, it cannot be invoked as an authorization for capital punishment. \n\n \n[355]  A full conceptualization of the right to life will have to await examination of a multitude of \ncomplex issues, each of which has its own contextual setting and particularities.  In \ncontrast to capital punishment, there are circumstances relating to the right to life where \nproportionality could well play an important role in balancing out competing interests.   \nWhether or not section 33 would be applicable in each case, or whether proportionality \nwill enter into the definition of the ambit of the right itself, or whether it relates simply to \ncompetition between two or more people to exercise the right when it is under immediate \nthreat, need not be decided here.  Thus, the German Constitutional Court has relied \nheavily on the principle of proportionality in relation to the question of when person-\n\n \n \n\n187 \n\n\f \n \n\nSACHS J \n\nhood and legally protected life begin and, in particular of how to balance foetal rights as \nagainst the rights of the woman concerned.2    Force used by the State in cases of self-\ndefence or dealing with hostage-takers or mutineers, must be proportionate to the danger \napprehended; the issue arises because two or more persons compete for the right to life; \nfor the one to live, the other must die.  The imminence of danger is fundamental: to kill \nan assailant or hostage-taker or prisoner of war after he or she has been disarmed, is \nregarded as murder. \n\n \n[356]  Executing a trussed human being long after the violence has ended, totally lacks  proportionality \nin relation to the use of force, and does not fall within the principles of self-defence.  \nFrom one point of view capital punishment, unless cruelly performed, is a contradiction \nin terms.  The 'capital' part ends rather than expresses the 'punishment', in the sense that \nthe condemned person is eliminated, not punished.  A living being held for years in \nprison is punished; a corpse cannot be punished, only mutilated.  Thus, execution ceases \nto be a punishment of a human being in terms of the Constitution, and becomes instead \nthe obliteration of a sub-human from the purview of the Constitution.  \n\n \n[357]  At  its  core,  constitutionalism  is  about  the  protection  and  development  of  rights,  not  their \nextinction.  In the absence of the clearest contextual indications that the framers of the \nConstitution intended that the State's sovereignty should be so extended as to allow it \ndeliberately to take of the life of its citizens, Section 9 should be read to mean exactly \nwhat it says:  Every person shall have the right to life.   If not, the killer unwittingly \nachieves a final and perverse moral victory by making the state a killer too, thus reducing \nsocial abhorrence at the conscious extinction of human beings. \n\n \n\nThe Source of Values \n\n \n                                                 \n\n     288 BVerfGE 203 (2nd Abortion Case). \n\n \n \n\n188 \n\n\f \n \n[358]  The second issue that caused me special concern was the source of the  values that we are to \napply in  assessing whether or not capital punishment is a cruel, inhuman or degrading \npunishment as constitutionally understood.  The matter was raised in an amicus brief and \nargued orally before us by Ms. Davids on behalf of the Black Advocates Forum. \n\nSACHS J \n\n \n[359]  Her main contention was that we should not pronounce on the subject of capital punishment \nuntil  we  had  been  apprised  by  sociological  analysis  of  the  relevant  expectations, \nsensitivities and interests of society as a whole.  In the past, she stated,  the all-white \nminority had imposed Eurocentric values on the majority, and an all-white judiciary had \ntaken cognisance merely of the interests of white society.  Now, for the first time, she \nadded, we had the opportunity to nurture an open and democratic society and to have due \nregard  to  an  emerging  national  consensus  on  values  to  be  upheld  in  relation  to \npunishment. \n\n \n[360]  Many of the points she made had a political rather than a legal character, and as such should \nhave been directed to the Constitutional Assembly rather than to the Constitutional \nCourt.  Nevertheless, much of her argument has a bearing on the way this court sees its \nfunctions, and deserves the courtesy of a reply.   \n\n \n[361]  To begin with, I wish firmly to express my agreement with the need to take account of the \ntraditions, beliefs and values of all sectors of South African society when developing our \njurisprudence. \n\n \n[362]  In  broad  terms,  the  function  given  to  this  court  by  the  Constitution  is  to  articulate  the \nfundamental sense of justice and right shared by the whole nation as expressed in the text \nof the Constitution. The Constitution  was the first public document of legal force in \nSouth African history to emerge from an inclusive process in which the overwhelming \nmajority  were  represented.    Reference  in  the  Constitution  to  the  role  of  public \ninternational  law  [sections  35(1)  and  231]  underlines  our  common  adherence  to \ninternationally  accepted  principles.    Whatever  the  status  of  earlier  legislation  and \njurisprudence may be, the Constitution speaks for the whole of society and not just one \n\n \n \n\n189 \n\n\f \n \n\nsection.   \n\nSACHS J \n\n \n[363]  The preamble, postamble and the principles of freedom and equality espoused in sections 8, 33 \nand 35 of the Constitution, require such an amplitude of vision.   The principle of \ninclusivity  shines  through  the  language  provisions  in  section  3,  and  underlies  the \nprovisions which led to the adoption of the new flag and anthem, and the selection of \npublic holidays.   \n\n \n[364]  The secure and progressive development of our legal system demands that it draw the best from \nall the streams of justice in our country.  This would include benefiting from the learning \nof those judges who in the previous era managed to articulate a sense of justice that \ntranscended the limits of race, as well as acknowledging the challenging writings of \nacademics such as the late Dr. Barend van Niekerk, who bravely broke the taboos on \ncriticism of the legal system.3 \n\n \n[365]  Above all, however, it means giving long overdue recognition to African law and legal thinking \nas a source of legal ideas, values and practice.  We cannot, unfortunately, extend the \nequality principle backwards in time to remove the humiliations and indignities suffered \nby past generations, but we can restore dignity to ideas and values that have long been \nsuppressed or marginalized.  \n\n \n[366]  Redressing  the  balance  in  a  conceptually  sound,  methodologically  secure  and  functionally \nefficient way, will be far from easy.   Extensive research and public debate will be \nrequired.    Legislation  will  play  a  key  role;  indeed,  the  Constitution  expressly \nacknowledges situations where legal pluralism based on religion can be recognised \n[14(3)], and where indigenous law can be applied (s.181). Constitutional Principle XIII \ndeclares that \"...... Indigenous law, like common law, shall be recognised and applied by \n\n                                                 \n\n     3Cf. 1969 SALJ 455 and 1970 SALJ 60; S v Van Niekerk 1970 (3) SA 655. \n\n \n \n\n190 \n\n\f \n \n\nthe  courts,  subject  to  the  fundamental  rights  contained  in  the  Constitution  and  to \nlegislation dealing specifically therewith\". \n\nSACHS J \n\n \n[367]  Yet  the  issue  raised  by  Ms  Davids  goes  beyond  the  question  of  achieving  recognition  of \n\ndifferent systems of personal law.   \n\n \n[368]  In interpreting Chapter 3 of the Constitution, which deals with fundamental rights, all courts \nmust promote the values of an open and democratic society based on freedom and \nequality [s.35(1)].  One of the values of an open and democratic society is precisely that \nthe values of all sections of society must be taken into account and given due weight \nwhen matters of public import are being decided.  Ms. David's concern is that when it \ncomes to interpreting Chapter 3, and in particular, the concept of punishment, the values \nof only one section of the community are taken into account.   \n\n[369]  Paul Sieghart points out that \"the hallmarks of a democratic society are pluralism, tolerance and \nbroad-mindedness.  Although individual interests must on occasion be subordinated to \nthose of a group, democracy does not mean that the views of a majority must always \nprevail:  a balance must be achieved which ensures the fair and proper treatment of \nminorities and avoids any abuse of a dominant position\".4  The principle that cognisance \nmust be taken of minority opinions should apply with at least equal force to majority \nopinions; if one of the functions of the Constitution is to protect unpopular minorities \nfrom abuse, another must surely be to rescue the majority from marginalization. \n\n \n[370]  In  a  democratic  society  such  as  we  are  trying  to  establish,  this  is  primarily  the  task  of \nParliament,  where  the  will  of  the  majority  can  be  directly  expressed  within  the \nframework of a system of fundamental rights.  Our function as members of this court - as \nI see it - is, when interpreting the Constitution, to pay due regard to the values of all \nsections of society, and not to confine ourselves to the values of one portion only, \n\n                                                 \n\n     4The International Law of Human Rights, Oxford 1983, reprinted 1992, at p. 93 referring to James, Young \nand Webster  v U.K.  Judgment of the European Court of Human Rights on 13/08/81. \n\n \n \n\n191 \n\n\f \n \n\nhowever, exalted or subordinate it might have been in the past. \n\nSACHS J \n\n \n[371]  It is a distressing fact that our law reports and legal textbooks contain few references to African \nsources as part of the general law of the country.  That is no reason for this court to \ncontinue to ignore the legal institutions and values of a very large part of the population, \nmoreover, of that section that suffered the most violations of fundamental rights under \nprevious  legal  regimes,  and  that  perhaps  has  the  most  to  hope  for  from  the  new \nconstitutional order. \n\n \n[372]  Appropriate source material is limited and any conclusions that individual members of this court \nmight wish to offer would inevitably have to be tentative rather than definitive. We \nwould certainly require much fuller research and argument than we had in the present \ncase.  The paucity of materials, however, is a reason for putting the issue on the agenda, \nnot a justification for postponing it. \n\n \n[373]  The evolution of core values in all sections of the community is particularly relevant to the \ncharacterization of what at any moment are regarded as cruel, inhuman and degrading \npunishments [s.11(2)].  In my view, s.35(1) requires this court not only to have regard to \npublic international law and foreign case law, but also to all the dimensions of the \nevolution of South African law which may help us in our task of promoting freedom and \nequality.  This would require reference not only to what in legal discourse is referred to \nas 'our common law' but also to traditional African jurisprudence.    \n\n \n[374]  I must stress that what follows relates to matters not properly canvassed in argument.  The \nstatements I make should not be regarded as an attempt on my part to 'lay down the law' \non subjects that might well be controversial.  Rather, the materials are presented for their \npossible relevance to the search for core and enduring values consistent with the text and \nspirit of the Constitution.   It is unfortunate they were not placed before us to enable their \nreliability and their merits to be debated; they are intended to indicate that, speaking for \nmyself, these are the kinds of scholarly sources which I would have regarded as helpful \nin determining questions such as the present one, if Ms. Davids had presented them to us \n\n \n \n\n192 \n\n\f \n \n\nSACHS J \n\nrather than complain about their absence.  I might add that there is nothing to indicate \nthat had these sources been properly presented and subjected to the rigorous analysis \nwhich  our  judicial  procedure  calls  for,  the  decision  of  this  Court  would  have  been \ndifferent.  There does not appear to be any foundation for her plea that we postpone the \nmatter.  On the contrary, the materials that I will refer to point to a source of values \nentirely consistent with the overall thrust of the President's judgment, and, in particular, \nwith his reference to the constitutionally acknowledged principle of ubuntu.5 \n\n \n[375]  Our libraries contain a large number of studies by African and other scholars of repute, which \ndelineate in considerable detail how disputes were resolved and punishments meted out in \ntraditional African society.  There are a number of references  to capital punishment and I can \nonly repeat that it is unfortunate that their import was never canvassed in the present matter. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n     5See the postamble, also referred to as the epilogue or afterword, where reference is made to the \"need for \nubuntu\". \n\n \n \n\n193 \n\n\fSACHS J \n\n \n \n[376]  In the first place,  the sources indicate that it is necessary to acknowledge that systems of law \nenforcement based on rational procedures were well entrenched in traditional society.  In his \nclassic study of the Tsonga-speaking people, Henri Junod observes that \"... the Bantus possess a \nstrong sense of justice.  They believe in social order and in the observance of the laws, and, \nalthough these laws were not written, they are universal and perfectly well known\".6  The Cape \nLaw Journal, in a long and  admiring report on what it refers to as a Kafir Law Suit, declares that \nin a typical trial 'the Socratic method of debate appears in all its perfection.'7 John Henderson \nSoga points out that offences were considered to be against the community or tribe rather than \nthe individual, and punishment of a constructive or corrective nature was administered for \ndisturbing the balance of tribal life.8 \n\n \n[377]  More directly for our purposes, the materials suggest that amongst the Cape Nguni, the death \npenalty  was  practically  confined  to  cases  of  suspected  witchcraft,  and  was  normally \nspontaneously carried out after accusation by the diviners.9  Soga says that the death penalty was \nnever imposed, the reasoning being as follows: 'Why sacrifice a second life for one already \nlost?'10 Professor Z.K. Mathews is in broad agreement.11   The Cape Law Journal notes that \nsummary executions were usually inflicted for assault on the wives of chiefs or aggravated cases \nof witchcraft, but otherwise the death sentence 'seldom followed even murder, when committed \nwithout  the  aid  of  supernatural  powers;  and  as  banishment,  imprisonment  and  corporal \npunishment are all unknown in (African) jurisprudence, the property of the people constitutes the \ngreat fund out of which debts of justice are paid'.12   \n\n                                                 \n\n     6Junod, Henri A - The Life of a South African Tribe 2nd Edition published Macmillan 1927 at p. 436. \n\n     71889 CLJ 87 - Extracts from Maclean's Handbook. \n\n     8John Henderson Soga - The Ama-Xosa: Life and Customs, published Lovedale Press , South Africa; \nLondon, Kegan Paul, at p. 46. \n\n     9Hammond-Tooke D: The 'other side' of frontier history: a model of Cape Nguni political process, in African \nSocieties in Southern Africa ed.

The Sotho King \nMoshoeshoe was  said to be well known for his opposition to capital punishment, even for \nsupposed witchcraft,13 as was Montshiwa during his long reign as King of the Barolong.14  The \nabsence of capital punishment among the Zulu people apparently angered Shepstone, Lieutenant \nGovernor of Natal.  Donald Morris writes as follows: \n \n\n'Hearken to Shepstone on November 25, 1850, substituting capital punishment for the \nnative system of cattle fines in the case of murder: \n\n[379] \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n     13J M Orpen: History of the Basutus of South Africa, Cape Argus 1857, Reprinted UCT 1955. \n\n     14Molema SM: Montshiwa (1815 - 1896) Barolong Chief and Patriot (published C.

Know ye all ....  a man's life has no price : no cattle can pay for it. \n He  who  intentionally  kills  another,  whether  for  Witchcraft  or \notherwise, Shall die himself.\"'15 \n\n \n[381]  Thus, if these sources are reliable, it would appear that the relatively well-developed judicial \nprocesses of indigenous societies did not in general encompass capital punishment for murder.  \nSuch executions as took place were the frenzied, extra-judicial killings of supposed witches, a \nspontaneous and irrational form of crowd behaviour that has unfortunately continued to this day \nin the form of necklacing and witch-burning.  In addition, punishments by military leaders in \nterms of military discipline were frequently of the harshest kind and accounted for the lives of \nmany persons.  Yet, the sources referred to above indicate that, where judicial procedures were \nfollowed, capital punishment was in general not applied as a punishment for murder. \n\n \n[382]  In  seeking  the  kind  of  values  which  should  inform  our  broad  approach  to  interpreting  the \nConstitution, I have little doubt as to which of these three contrasted aspects of tradition we \nshould follow and which we should reject.  The rational and humane adjudicatory approach is \nentirely consistent with and re-enforcing of the fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution; \nthe exorcist and militarist concepts are not.  \n\n \n[383]  We do not automatically invoke each and every aspect of traditional law as a source of values, \njust as we do not rely on all features of the common law.  Thus, we reject the once powerful \ncommon law traditions associated with patriarchy and the subordination of servants to masters, \nwhich are inconsistent with freedom and equality, and we uphold and develop those many \naspects of the common law which feed into and enrich the fundamental rights enshrined in the \nConstitution.  I am sure that there are many aspects and values of traditional African law which \nwill also have to be discarded or developed in order to ensure compatibility with the principles \n\n                                                 \n\n     15Donald R Morris: The washing of the Spears - A History of the Rise of the Zulu Nation under Shaka and its \nFall in the Zulu war of 1879.

In the Dutch settlement, as yet unaffected by the changes sweeping Europe, torture was \nused until the end of the 18th century as  an integral part of the judicial process.16  Persons were \nnot  only  condemned  to  death,  the  judges  specified in detail gruesome modes of execution \ndesigned to produce maximum pain and greatest indignity over the longest period of time.  The \nconcept of a dignified execution was seen as a contradiction in terms.  The public was invited to \nwitness the lingering death, the mutilation and the turning of human beings into carrion for the \nbirds.  This is logical.  If executions are to deter, they should receive the maximum publicity, and \nthe killers should undergo an agony equal to that to which they subjected their victims.   \n\n \n[385]  Yet the British colonial administration that took over at the time of the Napoleonic wars, adopted \na  different  position.    Torture  was  abolished.    The  multiple  degrees  of  severity  of  capital \npunishment were replaced by the single relatively swift mode of hanging.  The reason for this \nwas that torture and cruel modes of execution were regarded as barbaric in themselves and \ndegrading to the society which practised them.  The incumbent judges protested that whatever \nmight have been appropriate in Britain, in the conditions of the Cape to rely merely on hangings, \ncorporal  punishment  and  prison  was  to  invite  slave  uprisings  and  mayhem.    The  public \nexecutioner was so distressed that he hanged himself.  All this is a matter of record.17   \n\n                                                 \n     16C. Graham Botha 1915 SALJ 319.

Current practices in the \nSouthern  African  region  as  a  whole  with  regard  to  capital  punishment,  testify  to  such  an \nevolution.  Information placed before this court18 showed that of six countries sharing a frontier \nwith South Africa, only one has carried out executions in recent years (Zimbabwe).  The last \njudicial execution in Lesotho was in 1984, in Swaziland in  1983 and in Botswana in 1986,  \nalthough capital punishment still remains on the statute books and people have in fact been \nsentenced to death in these countries.  Mozambique and Namibia both expressly outlaw capital \npunishment in their constitutions.  \n\n \n[387]  The positions adopted by the framers of the Mozambican and Namibian constitutions were not \napparently based on bending the knee to foreign ideas, as was implicit in Ms. David's contention, \nbut rather on memories of massacres and martyrdom in their own countries.  As Churchill is \nreputed to have said, the grass never grows green under the gallows.19  Germany after Nazism, \nItaly after fascism, and Portugal, Peru, Nicaragua, Brazil, Argentina, the Philippines and Spain \nall abolished capital punishment for peacetime offences after emerging from periods of severe \nrepression.  They did so mostly through constitutional provisions.20 \n\n \n[388]  It  is  not  unreasonable  to  think  that  similar  considerations  influenced  the  framers  of  our \nConstitution as well.   In avoiding any direct or indirect reference to the death sentence, they \nwere able to pay due regard to the fact that one of this country's greatest assets was the passion \nfor freedom, democracy and human rights amongst the generation of persons who fought hardest \nagainst injustice in the past.  Included in this was a deep respect, amounting to veneration, for \nlife.  The emerging nation could squander this precious asset at its peril.  The framers could not \n\n                                                 \n     18Applicants' heads of argument, taken from When the State Kills - The Death Penalty v. Human Rights, \nAmnesty International, London 1989. \n\n     19This is confirmed by South African experience ranging from Slachters Nek to the Cape Rebels to the 1922 \nStrike leaders to Vuyisile Mini and Solomon Mahlangu in recent times. \n\n     20Amnesty International op cit.  There has also been a marked move away from capital punishment in the \ncountries of Eastern Europe after the ending of authoritarian one-party rule there. \n\n \n \n\n198 \n\n\f \nSACHS J \n \nhave  been  unaware  of  the  fact  that  the  time  to  guard  against  future  repression  was  when \nmemories of past injustice and pain were still fresh.  If they chose sweeping language in favour \nof life, this could well in part have been because of a realisation that this was the moment to \nremove any temptation in coming years to attempt to solve grave social and political problems \nby means of executing opponents.   \n\n \n[389]  Historically, constitutionalism was a product of the age of enlightenment.  It was associated with \nthe overthrow of arbitrary power and the attempt to ensure that government functioned according \nto established principles and processes and in the light of enduring values.  It came together with \nthe abolition of torture and the opening up of dungeons.  It based itself on the twin propositions \nthat all persons had certain inherent rights that came with their humanity, and that no one  had a \nGod-given right to rule over others. \n\n \n[390]  The second great wave of constitutionalism after World War II, was also a reaction to gross \nabuse of power, institutionalised  inhumanity and organised disrespect for life.  Human rights \nwere  not  merely  declared  to  exist:  against the background of genocide and crimes against \nhumanity  committed  in  the  name  of  a  racial  ideology  linked  to  state  sovereignty,  firm \nconstitutional limits were placed on state power.  In particular, the more that life had been \ncheapened and the human personality disregarded, the greater the entrenchment of the rights to \nlife and dignity. \n\n \n[391]  Constitutionalism in our country also arrives simultaneously with the achievement of equality \nand freedom, and of openness, accommodation  and tolerance.  When reviewing the past, the \nframers of our Constitution rejected not only the laws and practices that imposed domination and \nkept people apart, but those that prevented free discourse and rational debate, and those that \nbrutalised us as people and diminished our respect for life. \n\n \n[392]  Accordingly, the idealism that we uphold with this judgment is to be found not in the minds of \nthe judges, but in both the explicit text of the Constitution itself, and the values it enshrines.  I \nhave  no  doubt  that  even  if,  as  the  President's  judgment  suggests,  the  framers  subjectively \nintended to keep the issue open  for determination by this court,  they effectively closed the door \n \n \n\n199 \n\n\f \nSACHS J \n \nby the language they used and the values they required us to uphold.   It is difficult to see how \nthey could have done otherwise.  In a founding document dealing with fundamental rights, you \neither authorize the death sentence or you do not.  In my view, the values expressed by section 9 \nare conclusive of the matter.  Everyone, including the most abominable of human beings, has the \nright to life,  and capital punishment is therefore unconstitutional. \n\n \n \n \nCASE NO \n \nCOUNSEL FOR APPLICANT \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nINSTRUCTED BY \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCOUNSEL FOR RESPONDENT   \n\n: \n\n: \n\n: \n\n: \n\nCCT/3/94 \n\nW.

I respectfully agree that -\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nsection 102 of the Constitution of the Republic\nof South Africa, 1993 (\u201cthe Constitution\u201d) did\nnot  entitle  the  Court  a  quo  to  refer  to  this\nCourt the issue of the proper interpretation of\nsection 241(8) of the Constitution;\n\nfor  the  reasons  given  by  Kentridge  AJ  the  proper\ninterpretation  of  section  241(8)  is  relevant  in  the\npresent  proceedings  and  should  be  determined  by  this\nCourt.\n\n[2]\n\nI  have,  however,  considerable  difficulty  with  the  proper\ninterpretation of section 241(8) which reads as follows:\n\n\"All  proceedings  which  immediately  before  the  commencement  of  this\nConstitution  were  pending  before  any  court  of  law,  including  any\ntribunal  or  reviewing  authority  established  by  or  under  law,\nexercising  jurisdiction  in  accordance  with  the  law  then  in  force,\nshall  be  dealt  with  as  if  this  Constitution  had  not  been  passed:\nProvided  that  if  an  appeal  in  such  proceedings  is  noted  or  review\nproceedings with regard thereto are instituted after such commencement\n\n\fMAHOMED J\n\nsuch proceedings shall be brought before the court having jurisdiction\nunder this Constitution\".\n\nThe  attraction  of  the  analysis  of  section  241(8)  which\nKentridge AJ has made, is that it is consistent with the literal\nwords of the main part of the sub-section which could, on that\napproach, simply be reduced to read as follows:\n\n\"All  proceedings  which  immediately  before  the  commencement  of  this\nConstitution were pending ............. shall be dealt with as if this\nConstitution had not been passed.\"\n\nThis  literal  interpretation  involves,  however,  a  number  of\nformidable difficulties.\n\nIn the first place it leads to some very unjust, perhaps even\nabsurd, consequences. Thus, merely because an accused person was\nserved with an indictment before 27 April 1994, (and even if no\nevidence  whatever  was  lead  before  that  date)  he  could  not\ncontend  that  the  provisions  of  section  217(1)(b)(ii)  of  the\nCriminal Code were unconstitutional.  In the result, the Court\ncould be compelled to convict him (and in consequence thereof\neven to imprison him for a substantial period) in circumstances\nwhere  it  has  a  reasonable  doubt  whether  his  confession  was\nfreely and voluntarily made and therefore even if the Court has\na reasonable doubt about his guilt.  Another accused charged as\nhis  co-conspirator  could  be  acquitted  simply  because  the\nindictment was served on him on 28  April 1994 in respect of an\noffence  arising  from  exactly  the  same  incident  and  the  same\nevidence.\n\nThe right of each of these accused to a \"fair trial\" in terms of\nsection  25(3)  of  the  Constitution  (including  the  right  to\ncounsel  in  terms  of  section  25(3)(e))  could  similarly  be\ndifferent because of the one day difference in the date of the\nservice of the indictment, although both accused were equally\nindigent  and  equally  in  need  of  counsel  in  order  to  avoid\n\"substantial  injustice\".  The  result  again  may  well  be  a\nconviction and resultant imprisonment for one accused and the\ntotal  acquittal  of  the  other,  based  purely  on  arbitrary\ncircumstances, \nobjective\nconsiderations.\n\nunjustified \n\ntotally \n\nany \n\nby \n\nA Judge passing sentence on the accused charged with committing\nexactly the same offence, on the same date and in exactly the\nsame circumstances, would be entitled to sentence one accused to\ndeath, and may be disentitled to do so in respect of the other\naccused in the same trial, merely because when the indictment\nwas sought to be served on 26 April 1994, the one accused was at\nhome and the other could not be located until the next morning.\n\n2\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n\n\f[7]\n\n[8]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\nExactly the same irrational discrimination would be present if\ncorporal punishment was sought to be imposed. Such a sentence\nwould be competent in respect of the one accused and might be\nincompetent in respect of the other, on the sole ground that the\none indictment was served on the day before and the other on the\nday after the commencement of the Constitution.\n\nSouth  African  statutory  law,  prior  to  the  enactment  of  the\nConstitution, is replete with the most disgraceful and offensive\nlegislation which discriminates against South Africans of colour\nand criminalizes arbitrarily and purely on the grounds of race\nand colour, perfectly innocuous acts of life and living by such\ncitizens.  It is possible that a citizen charged with such an\noffence before the commencement of the Constitution could, on\nthe  literal  interpretation,  be  convicted  and  sentenced,  even\nafter 27 April 1994, for having contravened a law, which sought\nto punish him on racial grounds, if his case was pending when\nthe  Constitution  came  into  operation.    This  is  a  plainly\noutrageous consequence.  It is suggested by Kentridge AJ that\nthe legislature and the executive can avoid such a consequence\nby taking steps to repeal the law or to cause the prosecution to\nbe withdrawn.  This is of scant comfort to the accused person\nconcerned, who might have no means to compel such a decision or\nwho  might  be  exposed  to  the  risk  of  a  conviction  before  the\nbureaucratic machinery of the State reacts to afford relief.  He\nis  entitled  to  say:    \"The  Constitution  affords  every  person\nequal protection against unfair racial discrimination.  I claim\nthat  right  for  myself  and  my  family.    You,  the  Court  must\nprotect me\".\n\nWhat these and many  other examples  would suggest is that the\napproach favoured by Kentridge AJ would remove the protection of\nfundamental  rights  to  substantial  groups  of  people  in  the\ncountry, simply because the proceedings in which the protection\nof such rights might be crucial for a person, had begun prior to\nthe commencement of the Constitution on 27 April 1994, although\nthe  substance  of  the  proceedings  takes  place  only  after  that\ndate.  I would be extremely distressed to accept that this is\nwhat the Constitution intended.  It seems to negate the very\nspirit and tenor of the Constitution and its widely acclaimed\nand celebrated objectives.  Fundamental to that spirit and tenor\nwas the promise of the equal protection of the laws to all the\npeople of this country and a ringing and decisive break with a\npast which perpetuated inequality and irrational discrimination\nand arbitrary governmental and executive action.  The literal\ninterpretation  would  invade  all  these  objectives  in  its\narbitrary selection of one category of persons who would become\nentitled  to  enjoy  the  human  rights  guarantees  of  the\nConstitution  and  the  arbitrary  exclusion  of  another  group  of\n\n3\n\n\fMAHOMED J\n\npersons from such entitlement.  The Courts must strive to avoid\nsuch  a  result  if  the  language  and  context  of  the  relevant\nprovision,  interpreted  with  regard  to  the  objectives  of  the\nConstitution, permits such a course.  What must be avoided, if\nthis is a constitutionally permissible course, is a result which\npermits  human  rights  guaranteed  by  the  Constitution  to  be\nenjoyed by some people and denied arbitrarily to others.  Such\na  consequence  would  effectively  allow  substantive  parts  of  a\ndisgraced  and  unacceptable  culture  from  the  past  to  continue\ninto a future, protected by the Constitution.  In proceedings\nwhich might affect their lives and liberties, large numbers of\nSouth African citizens would, on purely fortuitous grounds, be\nunable  to  assert  the  expanding  human  rights  guaranteed  by\nChapter 3 of the Constitution, including the fundamental right\nto a fair trial protected by section 25(3).  Such a result would\nbe inconsistent with the international culture of constitutional\njurisprudence  which  has  developed  to  give  to  constitutional\ninterpretation  a  purposive  and  generous  focus.    It  seeks  to\navoid what Lord Wilberforce called\n\n\"the austerity of tabulated legalism\" (Minister o f   H o m e   A f f a i r s\n(Bermuda) v Fisher 1980 AC 319 at 328H).\n\nThis is because\n\n\"A Constitution is an organic instrument.  Although it is enacted in\nthe form of a statute it is sui generis.  It must broadly, liberally\nand  purposively  be  interpreted  so  as  to  avoid  \"the  austerity  of\ntabulated  legalism\"  and  so  as  to  enable  it  to  continue  to  play  a\ncreative and dynamic role in the expression and the achievement of the\nideals  and  aspirations  of  the  nation,  in  the  articulation  of  the\nvalues  bonding  its  people  and  in  disciplining  its  Government.\"\n(Government of the Republic of Namibia and Another v Cultura 2000 and\nAnother 1994 (1) SA 407 at 418).  \n\nAn interpretation of section 241(8) which withholds the rights\nguaranteed by Chapter 3 of the Constitution from those involved\nin proceedings which fortuitously commenced before the operation\nof  the  Constitution  would  not  give  to  that  Chapter  a\nconstruction which is \"most beneficial to the widest possible\namplitude\u201d and should therefore be avoided if the language and\ncontext  of  the  relevant  sections  reasonably  permits  such  a\ncourse.  (S v Zuma and Others 1995(4) BCLR 401 (SA) ;  James v\nCommonwealth of Australia [1936] AC 578 at 614;  Minister of\nDefence, Namibia v Mwandingi 1992 (2) SA 355 (NmS) at 361-3;  S\nv Acheson 1991 (2) SA 805 (Nm) at  813A-C;  S v Marwane 1982 (3)\nSA  717  (A)  at  748-749G;    Ex  parte  Cabinet  for  the  Interim\nGovernment  of  South  West  Africa:    In  re  Advisory  Opinion  in\nterms of s 19(2) of Proc R101 of 1985 (RSA) (supra at 853C-G);\nHewlett v Minister of Finance and Another 1982 (1) SA 490 (ZS);\n\n4\n\n[9]\n\n\f[10]\n\n[11]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\nMinister of Home Affairs and Others v Dabengwa and Another 1982\n(4) SA 301 (ZS) at 306E-H; Minister of Home Affairs v Bickle and\nOthers  1984  (2)  SA  439  (ZS)  at  447C-G;    Zimbabwe  Township\nDevelopers  (Pvt)  Ltd  v  Lou's  Shoes  (Pvt)  Ltd  1984  (2)  SA\n778(ZS);  and Bull v Minister of Home Affairs 1986 (3) SA 870\n(ZH & ZS) at 872J-873C and at 880J-881C.)\n\nThe second difficulty I have with the literal approach is that\nif  the  death  sentence  or  corporal  punishment  are  held  to  be\nunconstitutional, the Court would be imposing sentences which\ncould not lawfully be executed in terms of section 7(2) of the\nConstitution.  The lawmaker should not lightly be imputed with\nthe intention to authorise the Court to impose sentences which\ncould not lawfully be executed.  Even if the Constitution had\nintended to vest in the Court, irrationally, the authority to\nimpose  sentences  which  would  not  constitutionally  be\nimplemented, what happens to accused persons who have received\nsuch sentences? No obvious and easy legal machinery is created\nfor  the  substitution  of  a  competent  sentence  after  the\nimplementation  of  the  constitutionally  impermissible  sentence\nhas been restrained, perhaps by a Court order.\n\nThere is another problem:  if pending proceedings have literally\nto be dealt with as if the whole of the Constitution had not\nbeen  passed,  by  virtue  of  what  law  could  the  Court  in  such\nproceedings  refer  any  question  for  determination  by  the\nConstitutional Court?  It could not rely on section 102 to do so\nbecause this is a provision of the Constitution and if it relied\non  it,  it  would  not  be  dealing  with  the  matter  \"as  if  this\nConstitution  had  not  been  passed.\"    It  is  true  that  if  this\nCourt makes a decision on the question so referred to it by the\nSupreme Court it would be exercising a jurisdiction given to it\nin  terms  of  the  Constitution  but  that  does  not  overcome  the\ndifficulty that its jurisdiction can only be exercised in the\ncircumstances if there has been a proper referral and if the\nCourt making the referral had no jurisdiction to do so there\ncould not have been a proper referral. \n\n[12]\n\nOn the interpretation favoured by Kentridge AJ the reference in\nsection 241(8) to -\n\n\"any court of law, exercising jurisdiction in accordance with the law\nthen in force\"\n\nis  quite  incongruous  and  difficult  to  understand.    If  the\nintention of the section was simply that all proceedings which\nwere pending before the commencement of the Constitution before\na Court of law or other tribunal should be dealt with as if the\nwhole of the Constitution had not been passed, the qualification\nthat  such  a  Court  of  law  or  tribunal  had  to  be  \"exercising\njurisdiction  in  accordance  with  the  law  then  in  force\"  would\n\n5\n\n\f[13]\n\n[14]\n\n[15]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\nappear  to  be  quite  unnecessary.    If  that  phrase  was  absent,\ncould it conceivably have been contended that the reference to\n\"any court of law\" or \u201ctribunal\u201d included a reference to illegal\ntribunals such as informal kangaroo courts?  In my view, \"any\ncourt of law\" or \u201ctribunal\u201d must mean one lawfully exercising\nits jurisdiction.  The qualification that it must be a \u201ccourt of\nlaw\u201d or \u201ctribunal\u201d \"exercising jurisdiction in accordance with\nthe  law  then  in  force\"  would  therefore  add  nothing  to  the\nmeaning  of  \"any  court  of  law\"  or  \u201ctribunal\u201d  without  any\nqualification.\n\nOn  the  interpretation  favoured  by  Kentridge  AJ  the  relevant\nphrase therefore serves no purpose. On the interpretation which\nI  favour  and  which  I  will  deal  with  later,  it  does  serve  an\nimportant purpose:  it serves to emphasise that the object of\nthe section is to preserve the authority of Courts dealing with\npending matters to continue to discharge their functions as such\nCourts. \n\nIn his analysis Kentridge AJ refers to various presumptions of\napplication in the interpretation of statutes and states that\n\n\"it is against this background that the purpose of section 241(8) can\nbe understood\".\n\nIncluded in the presumptions which he applies is the presumption\nthat\n\n\"a statute is as far as possible to be construed as operating only on\nfacts which come into existence after its passing\"\n\nand the presumption that a new statute is\n\n\"not  to  effect  matters  which  are  the  subject  of  pending  legal\nproceedings\".\n\nKentridge  AJ  considers  these  presumptions  to  support  the\nconclusion  to  which  he  arrives  in  the  proper  construction  of\nsection  241(8).    I  have  no  difficulty  with  his  views  on  the\ncontent of these presumptions but if the section simply seeks to\nachieve  what  would  in  any  event  be  the  result  of  these\npresumptions,  it  would  seem  to  me  to  be  unnecessary.    The\npresumptions  do  not  have  to  be  statutorily  re-articulated  in\norder to preserve their effect.\n\nNone of these very serious difficulties can justify a refusal to\ngive  effect  to  the  words  of  the  section  if  they  were  not\nreasonably  capable  of  an  alternative  construction.    Such  an\nalternative construction would have to be based not only on the\nliteral meaning of the words \"as if this Constitution had not\nbeen  passed\"  in  isolation  but,  in  its  proper  context.    The\nrelevant context would be section 241(8) itself, section 241 as\na whole and the larger context of the Constitution regarded as\na holistic and integrated document with critical and important\nobjectives.    The  crucial  question  is  whether,  adopting  this\n\n6\n\n\f[16]\n\n[17]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\napproach, such an alternative construction to section 241(8) is\nreasonably available.  \n\nIn the decided cases in the Provincial and Local Divisions of\nthe  Supreme  Court  at  least  three  alternatives  are  suggested.\nThe first is the approach adopted by Cloete J in Shabalala and\nOthers v The Attorney-General of the Transvaal and Others 1994\n(6) BCLR 85 (T); 1995 (1) SA 608 (T) and followed in Jurgens v\nThe Editor, The Sunday Times Newspaper and Another 1995 (1) BCLR\n97 (W).  What it amounts to is that the reference to \u201cpending\nproceedings\u201d  in  section  241(8)  means  simply  the  particular\nproceedings  within  the  case  which  were  pending  immediately\nbefore  the  commencement  of  the  Constitution.    Thus,  an\napplication made before the commencement of the Constitution for\nlegal representation at State expense, or to admit a confession\nin  terms  of  section  217  of  the  Criminal  Code  or  even  an\napplication to impose the death sentence or corporal punishment\nwould have to be dealt with as if the Constitution had not been\npassed.  Other applications made after the commencement of the\nConstitution, would be dealt with in terms of the Constitution.\n\nAttractive as the consequences of this approach may otherwise\nbe,  I am unable to support it.  What section 241(8) applies to\nis  \"all  proceedings  which  are  pending\".    What  the  approach\nfavoured  by  Cloete  J  effectively  does  is  to  limit  its\napplication to interlocutory procedures within such proceedings.\nThere seems scant justification for this either in the language\nof section 241(8) or its context.  Moreover it is inconsistent\nwith the use of the word \"proceedings\" in section 241(9) which\nprovides that \"any legal proceedings instituted before or after\nthe  commencement  of  the  Constitution\"  by  or  against  certain\nfunctionaries  which  ceased  to  exist  after  such  commencement,\ncould be continued by or against the relevant functionary which\nsuperseded  the  original  functionary.    Clearly,  the  ambit  of\n\"proceedings\" in this regard cannot be limited to interlocutory\nproceedings  within  the  larger  case.    There  is  no  persuasive\nreason  why  it  should  have  such  a  limited  meaning  in  section\n241(8).\n\n[18]\n\nThe  second  approach  is  that  favoured  by  the  Cape  Provincial\nDivision in S v W and Others 1994 (2) BCLR 135(C); 1994 (4) SA\n126 (C).  Substantially what it amounts to is that there is a\ndistinction between fundamental rights of a procedural nature\nand those of a substantive nature and that the proper meaning of\nsection 241(8) is that only fundamental rights of a procedural\nnature sanctioned by the Constitution would not be available to\nan accused person in pending proceedings.\n\n7\n\n\f[19]\n\n[20]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\nA serious difficulty which I have with this approach is that\nthere is nothing in section 241(8) which seeks to distinguish\nbetween  rights  of  a  procedural  nature  from  those  of  a\nsubstantive nature.  Moreover, the distinction made raises the\ncomplex  problem  of  satisfactorily  classifying  what  right  in\nChapter  3  can  be  said  to  constitute  a  procedural  right  as\ndistinct from a substantive right.  (See Yew Bon Tew v Kenderaan\nBas Mara [1982] 3 All ER 833 (PC) at 838f-g;  Industrial Council\nfor the Furniture Manufacturing Industry (Natal) v Minister of\nManpower and another  1984  (2)  SA  238(D)  at  242F;   Euromarine\nInternational of Mauren v The Ship Berg and Others 1984 (4) SA\n647 (N) at 661I-662A.)  Furthermore, this distinction assumes\nthat a right is either procedural or substantive.  It could be\na hybrid right involving both.  What is the right set out in\nsection  25(3)  to  \"legal  representation  at  State  expense  if\nsubstantial injustice would otherwise result\"?  Is it procedural\nor substantive?  If it involves both substantive and procedural\nelements, what is the  dominant element?  Is that the test to be\napplied in classifying the right?  If it is and the dominant\nelement  is  procedural,  how  does  it  help  the  argument  that\nsection  241(8)  was  never  intended  to  take  away  fundamental\nrights  in  pending  proceedings?    Is  the  right  to  \u201clegal\nrepresentation at State expense if substantial injustice would\notherwise result\u201d any the less fundamental for being procedural?\nI find it  difficult to accept that the law-maker intended to\nleave uncertain and unresolved serious disputes of this kind in\nthe crucial area of fundamental rights.  \n\nA  third  alternative  suggested  by  some  of  the  cases  in  the\nProvincial and Local Divisions of the Supreme Court is that the\nobject  of  section  241(8)  is  to  preserve  the  continuing\nterritorial  jurisdiction  of  the  Courts  in  which  the  case  was\npending immediately before the commencement of the Constitution\n(Qozoleni v Minister of Law and Order and Another  1994 (1) BCLR\n75  (E);  1994  (3)  SA  625  (E);    S  v  Majavu  1994  (2)  BCLR  56\n(CKGD);  1994 (4) SA 268 (Ck);  Gardener v Whitaker 1994 (5)\nBCLR 19(E);  S v Shuma 1994 (2) SACR 486 (E)).  In my view, the\nspecial emphasis on \"territorial jurisdiction\" is not justified\nby  section  241(8),  but  the  emphasis  on  the  jurisdictional\nobjectives of the section provides a basis for an alternative\napproach to the meaning of the section that can constitutionally\nbe defended.\n\n[21]\n\nWhat the section seeks to preclude is an attack on the authority\nof  any  Court  of  law  or  tribunal  to  continue  dealing  with\nproceedings which were pending before the commencement of the\nConstitution.  What the section would then mean is that:-\n\n\"All  proceedings  which  immediately  before  the  commencement  of  this\n\n8\n\n\f[22]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\nConstitution  were  pending  before  any  Court  of  law,  including  any\ntribunal  or  reviewing  authority,  established  by  or  under  law,\nexercising  jurisdiction  in  accordance  with  the  law  then  in  force,\nshall be dealt with as if the passing of this Constitution had not\nimpacted on that jurisdiction:  provided that if an appeal in such\nproceedings is noted or review proceedings with regard thereto are\ninstituted after such proceedings, such proceedings shall be brought\nbefore the Court having jurisdiction under this Constitution and the\nCourt or tribunal which might otherwise in terms of this section have\nhad authority to deal with such appeal or review shall have no such\nauthority.\"  \n\n(See, for example, S v Smith and Another 1994 (1) BCLR 63 (SE);\n1994  (3)  SA  887  (SE);  S  v  Saib  1994  (2)  BCLR  48  (D);  S  v\nSixaxeni 1994 (3) BCLR 75 (C); 1994 (3) SA 733 (C).)\n\nTo  appreciate  why  sections  241(8)  had  to  be  enacted  to  give\neffect to this intention it is necessary to understand that what\nthe Constitution does is to establish a new legal and political\norder  involving  a  new  Parliament,  a  new  Executive  and  a  new\nJudiciary.  In terms of Chapter 7 of the Constitution, a new\nConstitutional Court is established in section 98, a new Supreme\nCourt  is  established  in  terms  of  section  101  and  other  new\nCourts  are  established  in  terms  of  section  103.    But,  the\nmechanics of the contemplated establishment of the new Courts\nhad to await the rationalisation process contemplated by section\n242.  That left a vacuum in the interim which section 241 seeks\nto fill.  It does that in section 241(1) by providing that every\nCourt of law which existed immediately before the commencement\nof  the  Constitution  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  duly\nconstituted by the Constitution or the laws in force after such\ncommencement.    The  word  \"deemed\"  means  that  the  Courts  which\nexisted  before  the  Constitution  were  in  truth  not  Courts\nestablished under the Constitution or any law in force after its\ncommencement  but  that  they  should  fictitiously  be  assumed  to\nhave been so constituted (see S v Voigt 1965 (2) SA (N) 749 at\n752F-G; Queen v Norfolk County Council (1891) 60 L.J.Q.B. 379;\nChotabhai v Union Government (Minister of Justice) and Registrar\nof Asiatics 1911 AD 13 at 33).\n\n[23]\n\nThe effect of section 241(1) is that the pre-Constitution Courts\nare legitimized as new post-Constitution Courts as if there was\na separate section in the Constitution or in some law after the\nConstitution  creating  such  Courts.    Section  241(1)  therefore\nwould allow a pre-Constitution Court to exercise jurisdiction in\ncases arising after the commencement of the Constitution but, it\nmight not be sufficient to authorize them to continue hearing\ncases  which  had  commenced  before  the  Constitution  came  into\noperation.  It seems to me that it is for that contingency that\n\n9\n\n\fMAHOMED J\n\nsection 241(8) was enacted.  I say this because what section\n241(1)  \u201cdeems\"  is  that  the  pre-Constitution  Courts  are  to  be\ntaken to have been established in terms of the Constitution and\nthis  must  therefore  mean  with  effect  from  the  date  of  the\nConstitution.    It  cannot  mean  from  some  date  prior  to  the\nConstitution because the Constitution operates prospectively in\nestablishing  new  Courts  and  not  retrospectively.    The\nConstitution does not contemplate that the new Legislature, the\nnew Executive or the new Judiciary should be established at any\ndate  before  the  commencement  of  the  Constitution.    Thus\ninterpreted,  a meaningful  role  is determined for the phrase\n\"exercising  jurisdiction  in  accordance  with  the  law  then  in\nforce\" in section 241(8).  Its role is to make clear that in\nproceedings which were pending before the commencement of the\nConstitution, the authority and jurisdiction conferred on the\nrelevant  Court  or tribunal by \"the law then in force\", would\ncontinue unimpaired by the Constitution \"as if this Constitution\nhad not been passed\" and as if it had not impacted upon that\nauthority.  This interpretation gives to what is a substantial\npart  of  the  section,  a  significant  purpose.    The  literal\ninterpretation,  in  my  respectful  view,  does  not.    This  part\ncould be omitted entirely without detracting in any way from the\npurpose  of  the  section  said  to  be  protected  on  the  literal\napproach.\n\nKentridge AJ, in paragraph 69 of his judgment, agrees with my\nconclusion that the reference to the relevant Court or tribunal\n\"exercising  jurisdiction  in  accordance  with  the  law  then  in\nforce\"  in  section  241(8)  was  indeed  intended  to  preserve  the\nauthority of a pre-Constitution Court to continue its function\nof adjudication after the commencement of the  Constitution in\ncases  which  were  pending  before  such  commencement;    but  he\nsuggests  that  section  241(8)  has  a  second  purpose  and  that\npurpose  is  to  ensure  that  such  pending  cases  should  be\ndetermined as if the Constitution had not been passed at all.\nI have some difficulty with that suggestion.  If Kentridge AJ is\ncorrect in concluding that \"another purpose\" of section 241(8)\nwas to ensure that the whole of the Constitution, including the\nprotection of fundamental rights enshrined in Chapter 3, would\nbe  inapplicable  in  pending  proceedings,  both  these  suggested\npurposes would have been achieved at the same time by providing\nthat \n\n\"all  proceedings  which  immediately  before  the  commencement  of  this\nConstitution were pending before any court of law ...shall be dealt\nwith as if this Constitution had not been passed\"\n\nwithout including the phrase\n\n\"exercising jurisdiction in accordance with the law then in force\"\n\nto qualify the Court of law referred to.  If pending proceedings\n\n10\n\n[24]\n\n\f[25]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\nwere to be dealt with as if the whole of the Constitution had\nnot  been  passed,  the  Courts  of  law  (or  any  other  relevant\ntribunal)  would  in  any  event  be  \"exercising  jurisdiction  in\naccordance with the law then in force\" because the Constitution\nwhich impacted upon that authority would have to be ignored and\nthe  authority    of  the  pre-Constitution  Courts  to  continue  in\npending  matters  would  therefore  have  remained  \"as  if  this\nConstitution  had  not  been  passed\".    In  my  respectful  view,\ntherefore,  the  language  of  section  241(8)  is  not,  in  the\ncircumstances, cogently  supportive of the suggestion that it\nhad two purposes.  The proposition that its only purpose was to\npreserve the authority of pre-Constitution Courts to continue to\nfunction as Courts for the purposes of adjudication in pending\ncases, appeals to me as a more persuasive interpretation of the\nsection.    At  the  very  least  it  seems  to  me  to  be  an\ninterpretation of the section which is reasonable and the fact\nthat it is more effective in securing the equal protection of\nthe  Constitution  for  all  persons  makes  it  significantly  more\nattractive and defensible.\n\nAlthough,  on  this  interpretation,  a  Court  \"exercising\njurisdiction  in  accordance  with  the  law  then  in  force\"  would\nhave  its authority limited to the territorial area in which it\nhas jurisdiction in terms of that law, in my view, the purpose\nof  section  241(8)  is  not  simply  to  regulate  the  territorial\njurisdiction of the relevant Court before which proceedings are\npending.  That issue is sufficiently covered by section 241(1)\nand  more  particularly  the  amendment  thereto  introduced  by\nsection  15  of  Act  13  of  1994.    This  amendment  introduces  a\nproviso  to  section  241(1)  which  defines  the  areas  of\njurisdiction of the Appellate Division, the Provincial and the\nLocal Divisions of the Supreme Court of South Africa, any other\nSupreme Court or general division thereof and any other Courts.\nSection 241(8) was therefore not introduced specifically to deal\nwith  the  areas  of  jurisdiction  of  the  Courts  before  which\nproceedings were pending at the commencement of the Constitution\nbut to ensure that their authority to deal with pending cases\nwas  not  assailed  because  of  the  fact  that  the  Constitution\ncreates new Court structures  with effect from the commencement\nof  the  Constitution.    Section  241(8)  creates  Constitutional\nlegitimacy for a pre-Constitution Court, to continue to operate\nas  a  Court  after  the  commencement  of  the    Constitution  in\nrespect  of  pending  matters.    Every  Court  needs  such\nConstitutional authority to function as a Court (see Smith and\nBrazier:    Constitutional  and  Administrative  Law  7th  Ed  (1994\nPenguin p. 69); Brown v Leyds N.O (1897) 4 OR 17;  Madzimbamuto\nv Lardner Burke 1968 (2) SA 284 at 331-2 (AD);  Madzimbamuto v\nLardner Burke (1969) 1 AC 645).\n\n11\n\n\f[26]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\nThis  interpretation  is  also  supported  by  the  direction  that\npending proceedings \"shall be dealt with\" as if the Constitution\nhad not been passed.  This is an unusually colloquial expression\nto be found in a formal statutory instrument.  If the intention\nof the law-maker was to say that pending proceedings should be\nadjudicated on the basis that the Constitution in all respects\nshould be ignored, it could have used clearer language.  Law-\nmakers are often concerned with the problem which arises when a\nnew statutory regime replaces the old but there is a continuing\nresidue of proceedings from the old.  This was the position when\nthe  Criminal  Procedure  Act  51  of  1977  replaced  the  previous\nCriminal Procedure Act of 1955.  Section 344(3) of the 1977 Act\nsought  to  protect  the  previous  proceedings  which  were  still\npending  by  directing  that  if  such  proceedings  had  not  been\nconcluded  at  the  commencement  of  the  new  Act  \"they  should  be\ncontinued and concluded\" as if the previous Act had not been\nrepealed.  Similar provisions appear in other statutes.  This is\nillustrated  by  section  12(2)(e)  of  the  Interpretation  Act  of\n1957 which provides in clear language that unless the contrary\nintention appears the repeal of a law \"should not affect any\ninvestigation,  legal  proceeding,  or  remedy  in  respect  of  any\nsuch right ... and any such investigation, legal proceeding or\nremedy may be instituted, continued and enforced ... as if the\nrepealing  law  had  not  been  passed\".    What  this  kind  of\nphraseology emphasises is a desire by the legislature to ensure\nthat the provisions of the previous regime will in the relevant\ncircumstances  apply  inexorably  to  the  final  end  and\ndetermination  of  the  proceedings.    \"Deal  with\"  is  a  more\nprotean, inherently more tentative idea.  The New Shorter Oxford\nEnglish dictionary (Volume 1;  page 601) discusses the meaning\nof the word \"deal\" when it is followed by the word \"with\" in the\nfollowing  passage:\n\n\"deal... Foll. by with:  be concerned with (a thing) in any way;  busy\nor occupy oneself with, esp. with a view to discussion or refutation.\nAlso,  take  (esp.  punitive  or  corrective)  measures  regarding,  cope\nwith, handle (a difficult person, situation, etc.).  ME. 11 v.i. Foll.\nby with or by: behave towards, treat (a person etc.) (in a specified\nway).  Also absol., act towards people generally (in a specified way),\nconduct  oneself.    ME  12  v.i.  Take  action,  act,  proceed  (in  a\nmatter).ME-M17.  13  v.i.  Set  to  work,  practise  (up)on.  arch.  rare.\nL16\".\n\nThe phrase therefore has different nuances but one of its well\nrecognized  meanings  is  to  \"Take  action,  act,  proceed  (in  a\nmatter)  ...  Set  to  work,  practise\".    These  are  perfectly\nappropriate  expressions  to  confer  authority  on  a  Court  or\ntribunal to  proceed  with or  take  action  under  the  authority\nvesting in it in terms of \"the law then in force\".  The \"Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary\" to which Kentridge AJ refers also includes\nin its discussion of the phrase \"to deal with\" the meaning:  \"to\n\n12\n\n\fMAHOMED J\n\ngrapple with\" and it also refers to \"deal\" as meaning \"to take\naction, act, proceed\".  These meanings are consistent with my\nview of the purpose of the section.  It is true that the idea of\n\"disposing\" the matter is in some contexts also a permissible\nnuance in the meaning of the phrase \"deal with\", but the very\nfact that it ordinarily bears the meaning of \"setting to work\"\nor \"proceeding\" demonstrates its inherently fluid and uncertain\ncontent.    It  is  probably  for  this  reason  that  it  does  not\nordinarily appear in statutes which seek to convey the idea that\nsomething should be \"continued and concluded\" as if the relevant\nlaw had not been passed.  If the intention of the Constitution\nwas  to  say  that  pending  matters  should  be  \"continued  and\nconcluded\" as if the Constitution had not been passed it would\nhave been a simple matter to say so in such a phrase of well-\nknown usage in our statute law instead of recourse being had to\nsomething so colloquial, flabby and uncertain as \"deal with\".\n\nI have examined the two cases mentioned by Kentridge AJ in which\nit is  said that  the phrase \"dealt with\" is used synonymously\nwith \"continued and concluded\" (S v Thomas and Another 1978 (1)\nSA 329 (A) at 334;  Pinkey v Race Classification Board 1968(4)\nSA 628 at 636 C-D).  With respect, I do not think they detract\nfrom what I have said. In Pinkey's case (supra) the Court was\nconcerned  with  the  effect  of  a  statutory  amendment  under  the\nnotorious race classification procedures of Act 30 of 1950 and\nreliance had been placed on section 12 of the Interpretation Act\nof  1957  (which  provided  that  in  the  absence  of  a  contrary\nintention a repealing law shall not affect any investigation,\nlegal proceeding or remedy in respect of any right or privilege\nand \"any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be\ninstituted, continued or enforced ... as if the repealing law\nhad not been passed\").  The Court held that this protected Mr\nPinkey from the statutory change made by the subsequent statute.\nIn the passage referred to by Kentridge AJ, Jansen JA stated\nthat there was no contrary intention and that \n\n\"it  follows  that  pending  cases  should  be  dealt  with...  as  if  the\nrepealing law had not been passed\".\n\nThe  Court  was  never  called  upon  to  apply  its  mind  to  the\ndistinction between \"dealt with\" and \"continued and concluded\".\nIt was never an issue in that case.  It could never be, because\nthe  relevant  part  of  section  12(2)  of  the  Interpretation  Act\neffectively  included  both  meanings.    It  allowed  legal\nproceedings to \"be instituted, continued or enforced\".  The case\nof  S  v  Thomas  (supra)  similarly  was  not  concerned  with  this\ndistinction.\n\nWhatever be the exact phraseology used, however, the basic idea\nof  legitimizing  the  authority  of  the  old  to  continue  that\nauthority  under  a  new  regime  has  a  long  and  very  well-\n\n13\n\n[27]\n\n \n[28]\n\n\fMAHOMED J\n\nestablished constitutional history.  Thus, section 116 of the\nSouth African Act, 1909, provided that all appeals to the King-\nin-Council which were pending at the establishment of the Union\nshould proceed as if that Act had not been passed.  The object\nwas simply to legitimise the authority of the Privy Council to\ncontinue  to hear appeals which were pending before  it at  the\ndate  of  the  commencement  of  the  Constitution.    This  same\nobjective  was  sought  to  be  achieved  by  section  1(2)  of  the\nSpecial  Courts  for  Blacks  Abolition  Act  34  of  1986  which\nprovided that an action pending in the Commissioner's Courts or\nan Appeal Court for Commissioner's Courts on the date identified\nshould be dealt with as if the section had not been introduced.\nThe purpose was to legitimize the authority of those Courts to\ndeal with cases which were pending before them.  Substantially\nthe same formula is followed when Parliament purports to create\nnew  States  and  Republics.    Thus  the  Constitutions  of  the\nTranskei,  Bophuthatswana,  Ciskei  and  Venda  all  provide  that\nproceedings which were pending before the commencement of the\nrelevant  Constitutions  in  certain  Courts  (created  by  South\nAfrican  statutes  in  respect  of  its  Black  citizens)  should  be\ncontinued  and  concluded  as  if  that  Constitution  had  not  been\npassed.  The object was again to legitimize the  authority of\nsuch Courts to deal with cases which were pending before them\nprior  to  the  commencement  of  the  Constitution.  (See  section\n54(c)(ii)  of  the  Republic  of  Transkei  Constitution  Act  15  of\n1976; section 91 of the Republic of Bophuthatswana Constitution\nAct  18  of  1977;  section  52(1)(d)  of  the  Republic  of  Venda\nConstitution Act 9 of 1979 and section 76(1)(d) of the Republic\nof Ciskei Constitution Act 20 of 1981.)\n\nThese kinds of statutory formulae were not confined to the TBVC\nStates.  Apart from the provisions of the South African Act of\n1909, they also appear in section 116 of the Republic of South\nAfrica Act 32 of 1961 which seeks to sanction the authority of\nthe Courts to conclude pending proceedings which were initiated\nbefore the Constitution in the name of the Queen who ceased to\nbe the Constitutional authority in South Africa in terms of the\nConstitution.\n\nIt seems to me therefore that section 241(8) does no more than\ncarry on a well-established constitutional tradition that when\nthere is a change of legal regimes, proceedings instituted but\nuncompleted  in  Courts  under  the  previous  regime  have  to  be\nprotected against a potential attack on the grounds that they\nhave  no  authority  to  dispose  of  such  cases  after  the\ncommencement of the new regime.  It must be conceded, however,\nthat  in  many  of  these  statutes  the  formula  adopted  for  the\npurposes of allowing pending proceedings to continue after the\nchange of the regime, created no comparable problems with regard\n\n14\n\n[29]\n\n[30]\n\n\f[31]\n\n[32]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\nto whether or not such Courts could ignore the provisions of the\nsubstantive law of the new regime in disposing of their pending\ncases.    This  is  because  some  of  these  statutory  instruments\ncontained  no  Bills  of  Rights  and  the  other  statutes  of  the\nprevious regime pertaining to substantive law were perpetuated\nby  suitable  provisions  in  the  new  statutes.    This  does  not\ndetract  from  the  fact,  however,  that  the  basic  objective  in\nsections analogous to section 241(8) is to confer authority on\nCourts to continue to hear cases pending before them prior to\nthe Constitution, notwithstanding the fact that the Constitution\nitself creates a new structure of Courts.  This is the position\nin terms of statutes which authorize such Courts to \u201ccontinue\nand conclude\u201d pending proceedings as if the Constitution had not\nbeen passed.  A fortiori this must be the position where the\nlanguage is less tight such as in the expression \u201cdealt with\u201d in\nsection 241(8).\n\nIt  must  also  be  remembered  that  although  most  of  the\nConstitutions and statutory instruments to which I have referred\ndo not create fundamental rights and do not therefore involve\nthe  problem  of  deciding  whether  the  relevant  sections  also\nentitle the Courts to ignore the substantive provisions of the\nConstitutions guaranteeing such rights, some Constitutions do\nhave such fundamental rights entrenched.  The Constitution of\nBophuthatswana does.  Significantly, however, the formula used\nis substantially the same and it has never been contended that\nin pending cases the Courts in that territory were entitled to\nignore  the  guarantees  conferred  by  the  Chapter  enacting\nfundamental rights. \n\nMy view of section 241(8) is also supported to some degree by\nthe  proviso  to  section  241(8).    A  proviso  qualifies  the\nsubstantive  part  (Mphosi  v  Central  Board  for  Co-operative\nInsurance Ltd 1974 (4) SA 634 (A) at 645; R v Dibdin [1910] P 57\nat 125).  The ordinary consequence of the substantive part of\nsection 241(8) would have been that all appeals and reviews in\npending proceedings would have had to be continued in the old\nCourts  established  prior  to  the  Constitution.  The  proviso\nreverses  that  consequence  by  directing  that  such  appeals  or\nreviews  must  (notwithstanding  the  substantive  provision)  be\ninstituted in the Courts which are given jurisdiction in terms\nof  the  Constitution  and  not  the  Courts  which  would  have  had\njurisdiction  under  the  old  law.    On  that  interpretation    the\nproviso flows naturally and logically to qualify the substantive\nprovision in section 241(8), if the substantive provision itself\nwere to be limited in its purpose to a legitimization of the old\nCourts and tribunals from the date when the proceedings before\nsuch bodies commenced. This is what attracted some of the local\nand provincial judges of the Supreme Court when they said that\n\n15\n\n\f[33]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\nthe literal interpretation of section 241(8) did not involve a\n\u201crational connection\u201d between the substantive part of section\n241(8) and the proviso (see, for example, S v Sixaxeni (supra),\nBCLR at 78D-E).  I think there is merit in the suggestion that\nthe proviso in section 241(8) flows more easily and naturally if\nthe substantive part is confined to the purpose of conferring\nauthority on the Courts to continue to function as such Courts\nand tribunals in respect of matters pending before them at the\ncommencement  of  the  Constitution.    To  that  extent  my\ninterpretation of section 241(8) is supported by the proviso.\nBut,  it  is  not  a  decisive  consideration  :  there  could  be  a\nlogical  if  not  particularly  natural  interpretation  of  the\nsection which would break the substantive part of section 241(8)\ninto two elements, the first dealing with the jurisdiction or\nauthority of the Courts or tribunals to continue to function in\npending  cases  and  the  other  dealing  with  their  right  and\ncapacity  to  ignore  the  Constitution  in  so  exercising  their\nfunctions and the proviso could be interpreted so as to limit\nthe first element and not the second.  The argument based on the\nproviso is therefore only one of many elements which must be\nweighed in the proper interpretation of section 241(8).\n\nThe  literal  interpretation  of  section  241(8)  involves  a  very\nradical constitutional consequence because, as I have said, it\nwould deny to a substantial group of people the equal protection\nof  fundamental  rights  guaranteed  by  Chapter  3.    I  would\ntherefore expect it to be articulated conspicuously in Chapter\n3 itself.  But section 7, which deals with the application of\nthe Chapter on fundamental rights, makes no such qualification.\nIt  says  in  section  7(2),  in  rather  peremptory  and  promissory\nterms, that this Chapter shall apply to all law in force and all\nadministrative decisions and acts performed during the period of\nthe Constitution and it does not contain any qualification or\nproviso that the rights of persons in proceedings pending at the\ncommencement of the Constitution are not included in the word\n\u201call\u201d.  It does not make section 7(2) subject to section 241(8);\nnor  does  it  say  that  section  7(2)  shall  apply  save  in  cases\nwhich were pending when the Constitution commenced.  Instead, if\nthe literal interpretation is correct, that radical consequence\nis  to  be  inferred  from  an  obscure  sub-section  dealing  with\ntransitional  arrangements  for  the  Judiciary  and  not  even  in\nsection  229  which  deals  with  the  transitional  provisions\npertaining the continuation of Laws.  I feel no confidence in\nseeking  to  infer  from such a provision a meaning which would\nentail the radical consequences which must inevitably follow for\nso many people, if the literal approach is adopted. I am also\nnot persuaded that this would affect only a tiny segment of the\ncommunity.  The present Constitution has a limited life and a\ngood  deal  of  the  litigation  in  the  Courts  might  indeed  be  a\n\n16\n\n\f[34]\n\n[35]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\nresidue  of  proceedings  commenced  before  the  Constitution.\nSignificantly, section 241(8) has become relevant for this very\nreason  in  the  majority  of  the  cases  which  the  Constitutional\nCourt has so far heard.  Kentridge AJ, in paragraph 83 of his\njudgment,  suggests  that  \"the  tension  between  Chapter  3  and\nsection 241(8) is likely to arise only in the respect of the\nfair trial requirements of section 25(3)\".  I am respectfully\nunable  to  agree.    The  Constitutional  attacks  on  capital\npunishment, corporal punishment, civil imprisonment for debt and\nstatutes founded on unfair racial discrimination, for example,\nare legally vulnerable without any reliance on section 25(3).\n\nMy suggestion that the purpose of section 241(8) was indeed to\nprovide  the  authority  for  a  Court  in  pending  proceedings  to\ncontinue as a Court is also supported by other sub-sections of\nsection  241.    Thus,  the  authority  of  the  Chief-Justice,  the\nJudge  President  and  other  judges  to  continue  in  office  is\nprovided in section 241(2) and 241(3).  The authority of the\nAttorney-General to so continue is provided in section 241(4).\nTheir  authority  to  continue  to  receive  remuneration,  pension\nbenefits,  gratuities  and  similar  privileges  is  sanctioned  by\nsection 241(5).  Section 241(8) appears in that context.  It is\na  transitional  arrangement  to  legitimize  the  authority  of\nimportant  structures  in  the  judicial  system  in  circumstances\nwhere that authority might otherwise have been assailable.  This\napproach to the objectives of section 241 is consistent with the\nobjectives  also  apparent  in  the  preceding  transitional\narrangements pertaining to Legislative authorities in section\n234,  to  Executive  authorities  in  section  235,  to  the  Public\nadministration  in  section  236  and  to  the  Public  service\ncommissions in terms of section 238.\n\nIt must be readily conceded that the interpretation which I have\nfavoured in this judgment is not free from difficulties.  One\ndifficulty with it is  section 241(10) which provides that the\nlaws  and  other  measures  which  immediately  before  the\ncommencement of the Constitution regulated the jurisdiction of\nthe  Courts  of  law,  Court  procedures  and  all  other  matters\npertaining  to  the  establishment  and  functioning  of  Courts  of\nlaw, shall continue in force subject to any amendment or repeal\nthereof by a competent  authority.  It could be argued that the\nterms  of  this  sub-section  are  wide  enough  to  preserve  the\nauthority of the old Courts in pending proceedings to deal with\nand dispose of such matters before them and that section 241(8)\nwas therefore not needed to confer such authority, as I have\nsuggested.  That argument does have  merit but I think that the\nanswer to it lies in the distinction between the authority of\nsuch Courts to continue as Courts at all in order to dispose of\npending matters after the commencement of the Constitution and\n\n17\n\n\f[36]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\ntheir  authority  to  continue  in  particular  areas  and  over\nparticular  persons  and  in  terms  of  particular  procedures  (if\nthey have authority to continue to function as Courts).  The\nformer authority is not sanctioned by 241(10).  The latter is.\nIt is the former authority which is provided by section 241(8).\nWithout it, it could have been argued that the old Courts had no\nauthority to function in pending cases although section 241(10)\nwould have defined how and what they could do if they had such\nauthority.  \n\nI am also alive to another difficulty in my interpretation of\nsection  241(8).    Although  it  gives  to  the  phrase  \u201cexercising\njurisdiction in accordance with the law then in force\u201d a meaning\nand  a  role  which  is  absent  from  the  literal  approach  to  the\nsection  which  I  have  described,  it  is  not  necessarily\ninconsistent with the inference that when the section directs\nthat  pending  proceedings  \u201cshall  be  dealt  with  as  if  this\nConstitution had not been passed\u201d it means that the whole of the\nConstitution,  including  the  Chapter  on  fundamental  rights,\nshould  therefore  be  ignored  in  such  circumstances.    That\nobservation is not without weight, but it is necessary to bear\nin mind that the relevant phrase is also not inconsistent with\nthe  inference  that  the  direction  is  simply  a  direction  to\nproceed  with  pending  cases  as  if  the  Constitution  had  not\nimpacted  on  the  authority  of  a  pre-Constitution  Court  to\ncontinue to function as a Court. Indeed, the phrase \u201cexercising\njurisdiction  in  accordance  with  the  law  then  in  force\u201d  makes\nthis  inference  more  probable.    What  the  phrase  emphasizes  is\nthat the relevant Court must exercise jurisdiction in accordance\nwith the law then in force, not that it must, in the exercise of\nthat  jurisdiction,  ignore  the  substantive  law  of  the\nConstitution.  This reference to the exercise of jurisdiction\nimmediately precedes the direction that it should deal with the\nproceedings  as  if  the  Constitution  had  not  been  passed.    It\ntherefore derives some flavour, colour, substance and purpose\nfrom its neighbour.  Such an approach would also be consistent\nwith  other  well-known  canons  of  construction  such  as  the\npresumption  that  the  law  giver  must  not  be  imputed  with  the\nintention to enact irrational, arbitrary or unjust consequences.\n(Hleka v Johannesburg City Council 1949 (1) SA 842 (A) at 852;\nVenter  v  R  1907  TS  910  at  914-915  and  921;    Lister  v\nIncorporated Law Society Natal 1969 (1) SA 431 (N) at 434;    R\nv Sachs 1953 (1) SA 392 (A) at 399).\n\n[37]\n\nI  have  considered  whether  there  is  perhaps  another  rule  of\ninterpretation  which  might  in  the  circumstances  of  this  case\njustify a result different from the one which I have favoured.\nThe  rule  I  have  in  mind  is  the  presumption  that,  unless  the\n\n18\n\n\f[38]\n\n[39]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\ncontrary  intention  appears,  a  statute  does  not  operate\nretrospectively  to  impact  upon  pending  proceedings.    (Bell  v\nVoorsitter van die Rasklassifikasieraad en Andere 1968 (2) SA\n678 (A) at 683; Thom v Moulder 1974 (4) SA 894(A);   Bellairs v\nHodnett and Another 1978 (1) SA 1109 (A) at 1148.)\n\nOn  this  approach  it  could  be  contended  that  since  the\nConstitution was not in operation when the proceedings became\npending within the meaning of section 241(8), an interpretation\nwhich compels a Court to apply the Chapter on Fundamental Rights\nto such proceedings constitutes a breach of this presumption.\nIn my view, this is not a sound argument.  In the first place\nthe presumption is not inflexible.  It operates only if there is\nno contrary intention.  In a very important sense a document as\nfundamental as a Constitution can itself be the basis for the\ninference of such a contrary intention.  This is particularly\ntrue of the Chapter on Fundamental Rights.  The presumption to\nwhich I  have  referred  is  intended as  a protection against an\ninvasion of rights which might have occurred in litigation;  it\nis not intended to exclude the benefits of rights sanctioned by\nnew  legislation.    Chapter  3  of  the  Constitution  seeks  not  to\ninvade but to expand rights.  The relevant presumption can have\nscant application in such circumstances (R v Sillas 1959 (4) SA\n305 (A) at 311; S v Williams 1979 (3) SA 1270 (C); Van Lear v\nVan Lear 1979 (3) SA 1162 (W) at 1167G-H;    Dys v Dys 1979 (3)\nSA 1170 (O)).\n\nI  have  also  applied  my  mind  to  the  criticism  that  the\ninterpretation of section 241(8) favoured by me might be open to\nthe  pragmatic  objection  that  it  could  cause  some  measure  of\n\"dislocation\" in the running of trials which were pending on the\ndate of the commencement of the Constitution.  This objection\nundoubtedly  has  some  merit,  but  the  weight  which  must  be\nattached to this consideration must, with respect, be balanced\nhaving  regard  to  the  degree  of  \"dislocation\"  involved,  the\ncapacity  and  the  skill  of  the  Court  fairly  and  sensibly  to\nmanage its effects and the grave consequences of any alternative\napproach denying to an important and not insubstantial sector of\nthe  citizenry,  the  equal  protection  of  fundamental  rights\nguaranteed to all.  Thus approached, I am not convinced that the\n\"dislocation\" factor is sufficiently compelling to favour the\nliteral approach to the interpretation of section 241(8).  My\ninterpretation of the section does not involve any re-opening of\ntrials  which  were  completed  before  the  commencement  of  the\nConstitution.    Such  trials  can  be  eliminated  as  potential\ntargets of \"dislocation\".  Moreover, even in respect of trials\nwhich had commenced but had not been concluded before the date\nof  the  commencement  of  the  Constitution,  no  Constitutional\n\n19\n\n\fMAHOMED J\n\nchallenge based on section 25(3) would be competent in respect\nof any decision already  made during the trial but before the\ncommencement of the Constitution.  If, for example, an accused\nperson  had  at  the  commencement  of  the  trial  and  before  the\nConstitution came into operation, applied for and been refused\nlegal  representation  at  State  expense,  a  challenge  to  that\ndecision  could  not  competently  be  proffered  after  the\nConstitution  came  into  operation  notwithstanding  section\n25(3)(e).    What  could  be  asserted  would  be  the  right  of  the\naccused to be so represented from a date after the commencement\nof  the  Constitution.    If  the  application  is  granted  and  the\nlegal  practitioner  seeks  to  recall  witnesses  for  cross-\nexamination  it  will  not  be  on  the  grounds  that  the  original\ndecision  to  deny  such  representation  should  be  reviewed,  but\nsimply another example of the experience known to all practising\nlawyers when an attorney is engaged  on the third day of the\ntrial and then applies to recall witnesses.  He does not assert\na  right,  but  simply  the  invocation  of  a  discretion  in  the\ninterests  of  justice.    It  is  often  allowed  by  the  presiding\nofficer.    It  causes  no  \"disruption\".    Indeed,  it  is  often\nwelcomed because it assists the Court.\n\nOther  potential  \"disruptions\"  of  this  sort  can  sensibly  be\nmanaged in this kind of way by a balanced and mature judicial\nofficer.    The  danger  of  such  disruptions  is  limited  and\ncontainable.  In my view, it is not of a magnitude sufficient to\njustify the plainly untenable denial of fundamental human rights\nto accused persons who were fortuitously charged just before the\ncommencement of the Constitution but whose trials had not yet\nbeen concluded on that date.\n\nOn my interpretation of section 241(8) appeals would not create\nany  \"dislocation\"  either.    Appeals  arising  from  proceedings\nwhich were commenced and concluded after the Constitution came\ninto  operation  should,  in  principle,  be  determined  in  the\nordinary course on the basis that Chapter 3 of the Constitution\nwas clearly of application and if the protection of that Chapter\nhad wrongly been denied to the Appellant, the Court on appeal\nwould take that into account in making its order. In respect of\nappeals arising from proceedings which had commenced before the\nConstitution  came  into  operation  but  were  only  concluded\nthereafter,  there should again be no \"dislocation\".  If the\nparticular fundamental right relied on by the Appellant was of\noperation at the relevant time of the trial, the Appellant was\nentitled to rely on it and if it had been wrongly denied to him\nhe  would  be  entitled  to  suitable  relief  on  appeal.(Regina  v\nAntoine 4 CRR 126).  If it did not exist at the relevant time,\nthe Appellant would have no legitimate cause for complaint.  The\nremaining category concerns appeals arising from trials which\n\n20\n\n[40]\n\n[41]\n\n\fMAHOMED J\n\nhad commenced and were completed before the Constitution came\ninto  operation.    In  my  view  such  appeals  must  be  disposed\nwithout  applying  Chapter  3  of  the  Constitution,  because  an\nappeal inherently contains the complaint that the Court a quo\nhad erred in terms of the law which was then of application to\nit  and  not  in  terms  of  a  law  which  subsequently  came  into\noperation.    There  should  therefore  also  be  no  \"dislocation\"\narising from this category of appeals.  There is nothing in the\nwording  of  section  241(8)  which,  on  my  interpretation,  would\nentitle  an  Appellant  on  appeal  to  rely  on  Chapter  3  if  the\nproceedings  against  him  had  been  concluded  before  the\ncommencement of the Constitution.  Such an Appellant would have\nto confine himself to the substantive law which applied during\nhis trial.  The case of S v Thomas (supra) is not inconsistent\nwith  that  conclusion.    That  case  was  concerned  with  section\n344(3) of Act 51 of 1977 which provided as follows:\n\n\"Notwithstanding  the  repeal  of  any  law  under  sub-section  (1)  [the\nCriminal Procedure Act of 1955 was such a law] criminal proceedings \nwhich have under such law at the date of the commencement of this Act\nbeen commenced in any ... court ... and in which evidence has at such\ndate  been  led  in  respect  of  the  relevant  charge,  shall,  if  such\nproceedings have at that date not been concluded, be continued and\nconcluded under such law as if it had not been repealed\".\n\nIt was held that the Appellant in that case was not entitled on\nappeal  to  rely  on  the  provisions  of  Act  51  of  1977  which\nprovided  special  machinery  to  persons  suffering  from\npsychopathic disorder.  It therefore confirmed the approach that\nthe  law  to  be  applied  on  appeal  was  the  law  which  was  of\napplication at the time of the trial and not the law as it was\namended at the time of the appeal.\n\nIn the result there are no \"dislocations\" arising from appeals\nor  any  other  considerations  which  would  justify  the  plainly\nunequal consequences of the literal approach.\n\nI  have  also  had  regard  to  the  fact  that  even  on  my\ninterpretation  of  section  241(8)  not  every  anomaly  is\neliminated.    Kentridge  AJ  suggests  some  such  anomalies  in\nparagraph 83 of his judgment.  Included in that analysis is the\nsuggestion that the results of appeals might depend on when they\nhad been noted or when they had been set down.  For the reasons\nI have referred to, these are not anomalies resulting from my\ninterpretation.\n\nWhat is nevertheless true is that there may be some residual\nanomalies  arising  from  the  mere  fact  that  some  accused  might\nfortuitously  have  been  charged,  convicted  and  sentenced  just\nbefore the commencement of the Constitution without the benefit\nof one or other fundamental right identified in Chapter 3 whilst\n\n21\n\n[42]\n\n[43]\n\n[44]\n\n\f[45]\n\n[46]\n\nMAHOMED J\n\nother  accused  are  fortuitously  charged  just  after  the\ncommencement  of  the  Constitution  and  therefore  have  the\nadvantage of asserting such rights.  But that kind of anomaly is\ninherent in any situation where one legal regime based on human\nrights values is replaced on a particular date by another legal\nregime  which  had  denied  such  rights:    it  does  not  justify\nextending the anomaly to accused persons who were merely charged\nwith offences before the commencement of the Constitution, but\nwho seek to assert their fundamental rights during their trials\nat a time when the Constitution is of operation.\n\nI confess to considerable difficulties in all the theories which\nhave become manifest in the interpretation of section 241(8).\nNone  of  them  are  without  problems.    Its  controversial  nature\nmanifests itself in the diversity of  opinion which has agonized\njudicial deliberations on the meaning of the section almost from\nthe  very  inception  of  the  Constitution.    In  my  view,  the\ndifficulties  involved  in  the  approach  adopted  by  Cloete  J  in\nShabalala\u2019s case (supra), by the Cape Provincial Division of in\nS  v  W  and  Others  (supra)  and  by  the  Eastern  Cape  Provincial\nDivision of the Supreme Court in the case of Qozoleni (supra)\nand other cases following thereupon, are more formidable than\nthe  difficulties  involved  in  the  interpretation  based  on  the\nliteral approach and the interpretation which I have favoured in\nthis  judgment.    I  have  sought  to  deal  with  some  of  the\ndifficulties arising from my interpretation and contrasted them\nwith some of the difficulties inherent in the literal approach.\nI am of the view, however, that on a balance, my interpretation\nis  to  be  preferred  because  it  gives  force  and  effect  to  the\nfundamental  objectives  and  aspirations  of  the  Constitution,\nbecause it is less arbitrary in its consequences and because it\nis more naturally in harmony with the context of section 241(8)\nitself and the Constitution as a whole.\n\nThe literal interpretation, in my respectful view, has none of\nthese  advantages  and  it  is  not  compelled  by  the  text  of  the\nsection, read in its context and with regard to the objects of\nthe Constitution. It is clear from the express objectives of the\nConstitution, that it seeks to articulate and to guarantee the\nfundamental right to a fair trial to all persons; the literal\ninterpretation would deny such right to many.  The Constitution\nseeks  to  secure  for  indigent  persons  the  right  to  legal\nrepresentation at State expense if substantial injustice would\notherwise result; the literal approach would reserve this for an\narbitrarily  delineated  class.    The  Constitution  secures  the\nright to life and human dignity and guarantees protection from\ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to all persons; the\nliteral approach would deny reliance on this promise by those\nsought to be punished after the Constitution simply because the\n\n22\n\n\f[47]\n\nproceedings against them commenced before the Constitution.  The\nConstitution expressly entrenches the presumption of innocence\nallowing  an  accused  person  the  right  to  protection  from  laws\nwhich effectively reverse this presumption; the literal approach\ndenies such protection to potentially large classes of persons,\nincluding the very accused in this case.  The contrast, in every\narea of legitimate concern for the ends of justice, is stark and\ndistressing.  I am not persuaded that a proper reading of the\nConstitution compels me to accept these distressingly anomalous\nconsequences of the literal approach.\n\nThe  result  of  this  view  is  that  the  Applicants  in  the  case\nbefore  Page  J  were  entitled  to  invoke  the  protection  of  the\nConstitution  in  the  attack  on  section  217(1)(b)(ii)  of  the\nCriminal Procedure Act of 1977 which this Court has held to be\ninvalid in its judgment (in the Zuma case (supra)) on 5 April\n1995.  Notwithstanding the fact that the trial of the accused in\nthe present matter was pending on the date of the commencement\nof the Constitution, they are entitled to contend that the onus\nwas on the State to prove that their confessions were freely and\nvoluntarily made and without any undue influence.  In my view,\nthey are therefore still entitled to contend before Page J that\nin  his  determination  of  their  guilt  or  otherwise,  he  should\nproceed on the basis that section 217(1)(b)(ii) is inconsistent\nwith the Constitution and therefore invalid.  The Applicants are\ntherefore  entitled  to  a  declaration to that  effect.  I think\nalso that it would be proper to make a declaration in terms of\nsection 98(6) of the Constitution invalidating the application\nof  section  217(1)(b)(ii)  of  Act  51  of  1977  in  any  criminal\nproceedings in which the final verdict of the relevant Court was\nor may be given after 27 of April 1994.\n\n[48]\n\nThese conclusions also make it necessary to deal with an issue\nwhich was deferred by Kentridge AJ in the Zuma case (supra) in\nthe following passage (in paragraph 44):\n\n\"Whether  an  order  under  section  98(6)  may  and  should  encompass\nproceedings which were pending before 27 April 1994, depends on the\nproper  interpretation  of  the  Constitution.      As  indicated  at  the\nbeginning of the judgment that issue is deferred for determination in\nthe Mhlungu case\".\n\nIt follows from what I have said that the question deferred in\nZuma's case (supra),  in the passage I have quoted, should be\nanswered by saying that an order in terms of section 98(6) may\nencompass proceedings which were pending immediately before 27\nApril 1994. Because of the issues left undecided in the  Zuma\ncase (supra), the order in that case invalidated the application\nof section 217(1)(b)(ii) of Act 51 of 1977 only in respect of\ncriminal trials which commenced on or after 27 April 1994 and in\nwhich the verdict had not, at the date of the order, been given.\nIt did not, however, preclude an extension of these limits in\nthe  present  case.  In  my  view,  the  declaration  should  also\n\n23\n\n\fMAHOMED J\n\ninvalidate any application of section 217(1)(b)(ii) of Act 51 of\n1977 in proceedings which were pending immediately before the\ncommencement of the Constitution. It would also be arbitrary and\nirrational to deny to an accused person the right to rely on\nsuch invalidity merely because the declaration of invalidity by\nthe Court took place on a date subsequent to the date when his\npending trial was fortuitously completed. All accused persons\nwhose trials either began after the Constitution or which were\npending  immediately  before  the  Constitution  commenced,  are\nentitled to be treated equally. I therefore make the following\norder:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\nIt is declared that section 241(8) does not preclude an\naccused person in a criminal trial from relying on any\nof  the  applicable  provisions  of  Chapter  3  of  the\nConstitution in proceedings which were pending before a\nCourt of law immediately before the commencement of the\nConstitution.\n\nIn  terms  of  sub-section  (6)  of  section  98  of  the\nConstitution  it  is  ordered  that  the  declaration  of\ninvalidity made by this Court in the case of S v Zuma\nand  Others,  1995(4)  BCLR  401  (SA)  invalidates  any\napplication  of  section  217(1)(b)(ii)  of  the  Criminal\nProcedure Act, 1977 in any criminal trial, irrespective\nof  whether  it  commenced  before,  on  or  after  27  April\n1994, and in which the final verdict was or may be given\nafter 27 April 1994.\n\nLanga  J,  Madala  J,  Mokgoro  J  and  O'Regan  J  concur  in  the\njudgment of Mahomed J.\n\nKENTRIDGE  AJ  :  This  case  came  before  this  Court  by  way  of  a\nreferral  by  Page  J  in  the  course  of  a  criminal  trial  in  the\nNatal Provincial Division.  It was heard in this Court at the\nsame  time  as  the  case  of  S  v  Zuma  and  Others  1995(4)  BCLR\n401(SA), in which judgment was given on 5th April 1995.  Both\nreferrals raised the question whether section 217(1)(b)(ii) of\nthe  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  1977,  is  inconsistent  with  the\nprovisions of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,\n1993.  The referral by Page J also raised the question of the\nproper construction of section 241(8) of the Constitution, an\nissue which did not arise in the Zuma case.   In the latter case\nwe declared section 217(1)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Act\nto  be  invalid,  but  deferred  the  question  relating  to  section\n241(8)  for  consideration  in  this  case.    This  question  still\nrequires resolution, as the applicability of our declaration to\n\n24\n\n \n\n[49]\n\n\f[50]\n\nKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nthe  present  case  may  depend  on  the  interpretation  of  section\n241(8).  In order to explain why this is so it is necessary to\nrecount what took place at the trial before Page J.\n\nThe accused were charged with murder and other crimes alleged to\nhave been committed in April 1993.  An indictment in Afrikaans\nwas served on all five accused at Newcastle on 11th March 1994.\nPossibly  because  they  did  not  understand  Afrikaans  they\nrequested  a  copy  in  English.      An  indictment  in  English  was\nserved on them, but only on 4th May 1994.  The accused appeared\nbefore the Circuit Court for remand on 11th May and on 18th May,\n1994  and  pleaded  not  guilty  to  the  charges  before  Page  J,\nsitting with assessors.  At an early stage of the trial, the\nprosecution tendered evidence of confessions made by four of the\naccused, in each case before a magistrate.  In respect of three\nof them it relied on the presumptions created by proviso (b) to\nsection 217(1).  Defence counsel at once informed the court that\nhe would contend that sub-paragraph (ii) of proviso (b) was in\nconflict with the provisions of section 25 of the Constitution\nand therefore no longer of any force or effect, and would if\nnecessary  ask  for  the  referral  of  the  issue  to  the\nConstitutional Court.  As Page J said in his judgment, given on\n28th October 1994, a question which arose at the outset of the\nenquiry  was  whether,  in  view  of  section  241(8)  of  the\nConstitution, provisions such as section 25 had any application\nto the case before him.   Section 241(8) reads as follows -\n\"(8) All proceedings which immediately before the commencement of this\nConstitution  were  pending  before  any  court  of  law,  including  any\ntribunal  or  reviewing  authority  established  by  or  under  law,\nexercising  jurisdiction  in  accordance  with  the  law  then  in  force,\nshall  be  dealt  with  as  if  this  Constitution  had  not  been  passed  :\nProvided  that  if  an  appeal  in  such  proceedings  is  noted  or  review\nproceedings with regard thereto are instituted after such commencement\nsuch proceedings shall be brought before the court having jurisdiction\nunder this Constitution.\"\n\nThe question raised by Page J was whether, in the first place,\nthe proceedings before him could be said to have been \"pending\"\nimmediately before the commencement of the Constitution, i.e.\n27th April 1994; and, if so, whether on its proper construction\nsection 241(8) rendered the Constitution inapplicable to those\nproceedings.    Page  J  made  no  finding  on  either  of  these\nquestions.\n\n[51]\n\nWith regard  to  the first  issue, further findings of fact may\nhave  been  necessary.    The  term  \"pending\"  in  relation  to\nproceedings  may  have  different  connotations  according  to  its\ncontext.  See Noah v Union National South British Insurance Co\nLtd 1979(1) SA 330(T), 332 per Eloff J ;  Arab Monetary Fund and\nothers v Hashim, NO (No 4) [1992] 1 WLR 553.  As Hoffmann J said\n\n25\n\n\f[52]\n\nKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nin the latter case at 558, in the normal meaning of the term\nproceedings  \"are  pending  if  they  have  begun  but  not  yet\nfinished.\"   It is clear enough that a \"pending\" proceeding is\none not yet decided.  See King v King 1971(2) SA 630(O), 634;\nGroenewald  v  Minister  van  Justisie  1972(4)  SA  223(O),  225. \nWhat is not so clear is when a legal proceeding may be said to\nhave begun. \n\nSection 144(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1977, requires an\nindictment to be served on an accused at least ten days before\nthe date appointed for trial, and section 76 states that the\nproceedings  at  a  summary  trial  in  a  superior  court  shall  be\ncommenced by the serving of an indictment on the accused and the\nlodging  thereof  with  the  registrar  of  the  court  concerned. \nThere is nothing in the judgment of Page J to indicate whether\nthe Afrikaans indictment was withdrawn or was lodged with the\nregistrar and, in the latter event, on what date it was lodged.\nThese matters and, in general, the date of commencement of the\nproceedings,  were  and  are  questions  for  the  trial  court  to\ndecide.   All that one can say at this stage is that unless a\nduly served indictment was lodged with the registrar before the\n27th April, there would appear to be no basis on which it could\nbe  contended  that  on  27th  April,  1994,  the  proceedings  were\n\"pending\" in terms of section 241(8).1  But it does not follow\nthat, in the context of section 241(8), proceedings are pending\nas soon as the indictment is lodged.  It may be that for the\npurposes of that section criminal proceedings are pending only\non plea, or when the evidence has begun.  (Compare section 344\n(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977.)   That is a question\nwe do not now decide.  \n\n[53]\n\nAt all events, at the trial before Page J the State prima facie\nestablished that in relation to at least two of the confessions\ntendered, the requirements of section 217(1) (b)(ii) had been\nsatisfied.  But before any further evidence was led, and after\nhearing  argument,  the  learned  judge  decided  to  refer  the\nconstitutional issues to this Court.  His reasoning, in essence,\n\n1     In parenthesis, I point out that section 241(8) applies to civil as\nwell as criminal proceedings. In Roman Dutch law there was some controversy\nwhether civil proceedings were pending only upon litis contestatio or upon\nservice of the summons. Modern authority favours the latter view.  Michaelson\nv Lowenstein 1905 TS 3241 ;  Van As v Apollos and Others 1993(1) SA 606(C),\n609.  See also S v Saib 1994(2) BCLR 48(D), 53; 1994(4) SA 554(D), 559 per\nThirion J.\n\n26\n\n\f[54]\n\nKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nwas that fairness to the accused required that they knew with\ncertainty where the onus lay before they decided whether to give\nevidence in the  voir dire.   The parties in this case having\nmade no agreement under section 101(6) of the Constitution, the\nlearned judge considered that the issue might be decisive and\nheld that it was in the interests of justice to refer the issue\nimmediately to the Constitutional Court.   He accordingly did\nso, and suspended the proceedings before him in terms of section\n102(2) of the Constitution.\n\nIn this case were it not for the issue under section 241(8),\nthere would be no reason to doubt the competence of the referral\nof the issue  of the validity of section 217(1)(b)(ii).  That\nissue  entails  an  inquiry  into  the  constitutionality  of  a\nprovision in an Act of Parliament.  In terms of sub-sections (2)\nand (3) of section 98 of the Constitution, read with section\n101(3) that enquiry is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the\nConstitutional Court.   The course taken by Page J accords with\nthe provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 102 of the\nConstitution which read as follows-\n\n(1) If, in any matter before a provincial or local division of the\nSupreme Court, there is an issue which may be decisive for the case,\nand  which  falls  within  the  exclusive  jurisdiction  of  the\nConstitutional Court in terms of section 98(2) and (3), the provincial\nor local division concerned shall, if it considers it to be in the\ninterest of justice to do so, refer such matter to the Constitutional\nCourt for its decision: Provided that, if it is necessary for evidence\nto be heard for the purposes of deciding such issue, the provincial or\nlocal division concerned shall hear such evidence and make a finding\nthereon, before referring the matter to the Constitutional Court.\n\n(2)  If, in any matter before a local or provincial division, there is\nany issue other than an issue referred to the Constitutional Court in\nterms of subsection (1), the provincial or local division shall, if it\nrefers the relevant issue to the Constitutional Court, suspend the\nproceedings  before  it,  pending  the  decision  of  the  Constitutional\nCourt.\n\nPage J found that the issue was one which might be decisive of\nthe case and that, for the reasons which he gave, the referral\nto  this  Court  was  in  the  interests  of  justice.    As  to  the\nproviso to section 102(1), there was no factual finding which\nwas necessary for the determination of the validity of section\n217(1)(b)(ii).      As  there  were  other  issues  remaining  to  be\ndealt  with  by  the  trial  court  the  judge  suspended  the\nproceedings as required by sub-section (2).\n\n[55]\n\nWhat is open to doubt is the basis on which the issue arising\nunder section 241(8) was referred to this Court.  This Court has\njurisdiction under section 98(2) \"over all matters relating to\nthe interpretation... of the provisions of this Constitution\".\n\n27\n\n\f[56]\n\nKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nBut that, it seems to me, cannot be an exclusive jurisdiction.\nAlthough section 101(3) does not in terms give the Provincial\nand  Local  Divisions  of  the  Supreme  Court  jurisdiction  over\nmatters relating to the interpretation of the Constitution, such\njurisdiction must be implied.  Otherwise they could not exercise\ntheir  undoubted  jurisdiction  under  paragraph  (a)  of  section\n101(3)  to  determine  whether  there  has  been  a  violation  of  a\nfundamental right entrenched in Chapter 3.  It follows that Page\nJ  had  jurisdiction  to  interpret  section  241(8)  of  the\nConstitution and to determine its effect on the case before him.\nHe ought therefore to have made the necessary findings of fact\nto enable him to decide whether or not the case was a \"pending\"\none in terms of section 241(8).  I may add that there have been\nnumerous  (and  conflicting)  decisions  in  Provincial  and  Local\nDivisions of the Supreme Court on the interpretation of section\n241(8).\n\nWhat then of the competence of the learned judge's referral of\nthat issue?   I cannot read section 102 as entitling the judge\nto refer to this Court a constitutional issue which is within\nhis own jurisdiction.   In my opinion sub-section (2) of section\n102 deals only with procedure on references under sub-section\n(1).  Under sub-section (2) the words \"any issue other than an\nissue  referred  to  the  Constitutional  Court  in  terms  of\nsubsection (1)\" include other constitutional issues as well as\nnon-constitutional issues.   But no power to refer those other\nconstitutional issues is conferred on the judge.   In contrast\nto sub-section (1), sub-section (2) contains no words granting\nsuch power.   Nor does it require any finding of fact relevant\nto those other constitutional issues - a requirement which one\nwould expect if the power to refer such issues were intended.\nA  similar  point  arises  in  sub-section  (3),  which  reads  as\nfollows -\n\n\"(3) If, in any matter before a provincial or local division, there\nare  both  constitutional  and  other  issues,  the  provincial  or  local\ndivision  concerned  shall,  if  it  does  not  refer  an  issue  to  the\nConstitutional Court, hear the matter, make findings of fact which may\nbe  relevant  to  a  constitutional  issue  within  the  exclusive\njurisdiction of the Constitutional Court, and give a decision on such\nissues as are within its jurisdiction.\"\n\nThat  sub-section  is  not  well  drafted,  but  it  too  requires\nfindings of fact only in relation to issues within the exclusive\njurisdiction  of  the  Constitutional  Court,  and  it  contains  no\nwords which authorise any other reference.  In spite of the lack\nof clarity in the sub-section the only reasonable construction,\nit seems to me, is that the words \"if it does not refer an issue\nto the Constitutional Court\" must be read as referring only to\nreferences under sub-section (1).   Similarly, in sub-section\n(2) the words \"the relevant issue\" mean the issue referred under\n\n28\n\n\fsub-section (1).\n\n[57]\n\nThe only other provision authorising a reference by a Provincial\nor  Local  Division  is  sub-section  (8)  of  section  102,  which\nprovides -\n\nKENTRIDGE AJ\n\n\"(8)  If  any  division  of  the  Supreme  Court  disposes  of  a  matter  in\nwhich a constitutional issue has been raised and such court is of the\nopinion that the constitutional issue is of such public importance\nthat a ruling should be given thereon, it may, notwithstanding the\nfact that the matter has been disposed of, refer such issue to the\nConstitutional Court for a decision.\"\n\nIt may at some time have to be decided at what stage it can be\nsaid  that  a  court  has  disposed  of  a  matter  under  that  sub-\nsection.    In  this  case  the  sub-section  plainly  has  no\napplication.\n\nThe  referral  of  the  issue  of  the  proper  interpretation  of\nsection 241 (8) was therefore not competent.\n\nIt  is  convenient  at  this  point  to  say  something  about  the\npractice of referrals to this Court under section 102(1) of the\nConstitution.    The  fact  that  an  issue  within  the  exclusive\njurisdiction  of  this  court  arises  in  a  Provincial  or  Local\nDivision  does  not  necessitate  an  immediate  referral  to  this\nCourt.  Even if the issue appears to be a substantial one, the\ncourt hearing the case is required to refer it only\n\n[58]\n\n[59]\n\n(i)\n\n     \n\n(ii)\n\nif the issue is one which may be decisive for the\ncase; and\nif it considers it to be in the interest of justice to\ndo so.\n\nIn  section  103(4)  of  the  Constitution,  which  deals  with  the\nreferral  to  this  Court  of  matters  originating  in  inferior\ncourts,  the  referring  Provincial  or  Local  Division  must  in\naddition be of the opinion \"that there is a reasonable prospect\nthat the relevant law or provision will be held to be invalid.\"\nIn S v W and Others 1994(2) BCLR 135(C), 147G; S v Williams and\nFive Similar Cases 1994(4) SA 126(C), 139F, Farlam J said that\nalthough that was not an express requirement of section 102(1)\nit was implicit therein.  I respectfully agree.  See also Matiso\nand Others v The Commanding Officer, Port Elizabeth Prison and\nOthers 1994(3) BCLR 80(SE), 89G - 90D; Matiso and Others v The\nCommanding Officer, Port Elizabeth Prison and Another 1994(4) SA\n592(SE), 599G - 600E.  The reasonable prospect of success is, of\ncourse, to be understood as a sine qua non of a referral, not as\nin itself a sufficient ground.  It is not always in the interest\nof justice to make a reference as soon as the relevant issue has\nbeen  raised.    Where  the  case  is  not  likely  to  be  of  long\n\n29\n\n\fKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nduration it may be in the interests of justice to hear all the\nevidence  or  as  much  of  it  as  possible  before  considering  a\nreferral.  Interrupting and delaying a trial, and above all a\ncriminal trial, is in itself undesirable, especially if it means\nthat witnesses have to be brought back after a break of several\nmonths.  Moreover, once the evidence in the case is heard it may\nturn  out  that  the  constitutional  issue  is  not  after  all\ndecisive.  I would lay it down as a general principle that where\nit is possible to decide any case, civil or criminal, without\nreaching a constitutional issue, that is the course which should\nbe  followed.    One  may  conceive  of  cases  where  an  immediate\nreference  under  section  102(1)  would  be  in  the  interests  of\njustice  -  for  example,  a  criminal  trial  likely  to  last  many\nmonths, where a declaration by this Court of the invalidity of\na statute would put an end to the whole prosecution.  But those\ncases would be exceptional.  One may compare the practice of the\nSupreme Court with regard to reviews of criminal trials.  It is\nonly  in  very  special  circumstances  that  it  would  entertain  a\nreview  before  verdict.    See  Hiemstra,  Suid-Afrikaanse\nStrafproses (5de uitgawe), 764.  In any event, the convenience\nof  a  rapid  resort  to  this  Court  would  not  relieve  the  trial\njudge  from  making  his  own  decision  on  a  constitutional  issue\nwithin his jurisdiction.\n \nI should make it clear that these remarks are in no way intended\nas a criticism of the decision of Page J to refer the issue on\nsection 217(1)(b)(ii).  At the stage when he did so this Court\nhad not yet been convened, and no guidelines for referrals had\nbeen  laid  down.    The  issue  was,  moreover,  one  of  great  and\npressing concern to all criminal courts, and it was right that\nit be resolved as soon as possible.\n\nIt may be asked at this stage why it is necessary or  competent\nfor this Court to consider section 241(8) in this  case.   The\nreason is that  if  the  proceedings before Page J were pending\nimmediately  before  the  27th  April  1994,  and    if  that  section\nmeans that the proceedings had to be completed in all respects\nin accordance with the law as it existed before that date, it\nwould follow that the judge would have to deal with the case in\naccordance  with  the  requirements  of  section  217(1)(b)(ii),\nnotwithstanding  the  fact  that  this  Court  in  the  Zuma  case\ndeclared that section to be invalid.  In order to answer the\nquestion whether Page J is to apply the ruling in the Zuma case\nwhen the trial resumes, the question left open in the Zuma case\nhas to be decided, namely, whether an order in terms of section\n98(6) should encompass proceedings pending on the 27th April.  To\nanswer that question the meaning of section 241(8) has to be\ndetermined.    Moreover,  we  know  that  there  are  other  criminal\n\n30\n\n[60]\n\n[61]\n\n\fKENTRIDGE AJ\n\ncases  which  may  have  been  pending  on  the  27th  April  1994,  in\nwhich the same question may arise, although of course we have no\nway of knowing how many.  We heard full argument on this issue\nand  we  are  consequently  able  to  deal  with  it,  and  it  is\nappropriate that we should do so.\n\n[62]\n\nThere have been a number of competing interpretations of section\n241(8) in Provincial and Local Divisions of the  Supreme Court.\nI  shall  not  cite  all  those  decisions,  still  less  attempt  to\nanalyse them.  It will be sufficient to identify in summary form\nthe differing interpretations placed on the sub-section.\n\na) Some judges have held that section 241 (8) is intended\nto do no more than preserve the territorial jurisdiction\nof the courts in relation to cases pending on 27th April\n1994 and that the Constitution, including Chapter 3, must\notherwise be applied fully to those cases.  See e.g. the\njudgments of Froneman J in Qozoleni v Minister of Law and\nOrder and Another 1994(1) BCLR 75(E); 1994(3) SA 625(E)\nand Gardener v Whitaker 1994(5) BCLR 19(E);\nb)  Other  judges  have  held  that  section  241(8)\npreserves the existing law in pending cases only in\nmatters  of  procedure.    Fundamental  rights  of  a\nsubstantive nature are thus to be applied in pending\ncases.  See e.g. S v W and Others supra. In some cases\nit  has  been  held  that  procedural  rights  which  are\nfundamental are not necessarily excluded by section\n241(8), but that where existing procedures have been\nfollowed  in  pending  cases  they  are  to  remain\nundisturbed.    See  e.g.  Shabalala  and  Others  v  The\nAttorney-General of Transvaal and Others 1994(6) BCLR\n85(T);  Shabalala  v  Attorney-General,  Transvaal,  and\nAnother 1995(1) SA 608(T).\n\nIn all the above cases the judges have concluded that, given the\nfundamental  concerns  and  values  of  the  Constitution,  it  is\nunthinkable that a court should after 27th April 1994 pronounce\nany  verdict  or  sentence  which  has  the  effect  of  violating  a\nfundamental constitutional right of the person before the court.\n\nc)  The  third  line  of  decisions  holds  that  section\n241(8) excludes any application of the Constitution in\ncases  which  were  pending  at  its  commencement.    See\ne.g. Kalla and Another v The Master and Others 1994(4)\nBCLR 79(T); 1995(1) SA 261(T).\n\n[63]\n\nIn interpreting section 241(8) I would accept that it would not\nbe  right  to  ignore  what  Froneman  J  called  the  \"fundamental\nconcerns\" of the Constitution, (Qozoleni's case BCLR at 86A), or\n\"the  spirit  and  tenor  of  the  Constitution\"  (Shabalala's  case\nBCLR at 95F).  A purposive construction is as appropriate here\n\n31\n\n\f[64]\n\n[65]\n\nKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nas in other parts of the Constitution.  Nonetheless, a purposive\nconstruction requires one to search for the specific purpose of\nsection  241(8)  within  its  context  in  the  Constitution.    Its\nimmediate context is a section headed \"Transitional arrangements\n:  Judiciary\",  in  a  chapter  (chapter  15)  headed  \"General  and\nTransitional Provisions\".\n\nAs stated in the preamble, the Constitution creates a new legal\norder in South Africa.   The afterword recites inter alia that\nthe  Constitution  is  a  bridge  from  a  past  characterised  by\ninjustice  to  a  future  founded  on  the  recognition  of  human\nrights.  But the Constitution cannot wipe out all traces of the\npast  in  one  blow,  and  does  not  attempt  to  do  so.    It  was\nnecessary for the Constitution to consider how far the new legal\norder, especially the fundamental rights provisions of Chapter\n3, should affect actions taken or acts performed under the old\nlegal order before the Constitution came into force.  This is a\nperennial  legal  problem,  which  arises  whenever  a  new  statute\nrepeals  an  old  one.    Sometimes  repealing  statutes  contain\nprovisions which give a clear answer to the problem.  All too\noften they do not, and canons of statutory interpretation have\nbeen developed over the years to assist in solving the problem.\nIn  general,  our  courts  have  held  that  in  the  absence  of  a\ndiscernible  contrary  intention,  it  is  presumed  that  a  new\nstatute  is  not  intended  to  have  retroactive  or  retrospective\neffect.   This is not the place for a detailed analysis of the\npresumption, but a reminder of its scope may help to explain the\npurpose of section 241(8).\n\nFirst, there is a strong presumption that new legislation is not\nintended to be retroactive.  By retroactive legislation is meant\nlegislation which invalidates what was previously valid, or vice\nversa, i.e. which affects transactions completed before the new\nstatute came into operation.  See Van Lear v Van Lear 1979(3) SA\n1162(W).  It is legislation which enacts that \"as at a past date\nthe law shall be taken to have been that which it was not\".  See\nShewan Tomes & Co. Ltd. v Commissioner of Customs and Excise\n1955(4)  SA  305(A),  311H  per  Schreiner  ACJ.    There  is  also  a\npresumption against reading legislation as being retrospective\nin the sense that, while it takes effect only from its date of\ncommencement, it impairs existing rights and obligations, e.g.\nby invalidating current contracts or impairing existing property\nrights.  See Cape Town Municipality v F. Robb & Co. Ltd. 1966(4)\nSA 345(C), 351 per Corbett J.  The general rule therefore is\nthat  a  statute  is  as  far  as  possible  to  be  construed  as\noperating  only  on  facts  which  come  into  existence  after  its\npassing. \n\n32\n\n\f[66]\n\n[67]\n\n[68]\n\nKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nThere is a different presumption where a new law effects changes\nin procedure.   It is presumed that such a law will apply to\nevery case subsequently tried \"no matter when such case began or\nwhen  the  cause  of  action  arose\"  -  Curtis  v  Johannesburg\nMunicipality 1906 TS 308, 312.  It is, however, not always easy\nto decide whether a new statutory provision is purely procedural\nor  whether  it  also  affects  substantive  rights.    Rather  than\ncategorising new provisions in this way, it has been suggested,\none should simply ask whether or not they would affect vested\nrights if applied retrospectively.  See Yew Bon Tew v Kenderaan\nBas  Mara  [1983]  1  AC  553  (PC),  563;  Industrial  Council  for\nFurniture Manufacturing Industry, Natal v Minister of Manpower\nand Another 1984(2) SA 238(D), 242.  \n\nThere  is  still  another  well-established  rule  of  construction\nnamely,  that  even  if  a  new  statute  is  intended  to  be\nretrospective  in  so  far  as  it  affects  vested  rights  and\nobligations, it is nonetheless presumed not to affect matters\nwhich are the subject of pending legal proceedings.  See Bell v\nVoorsitter  van  die  Rasklassifikasieraad  en  Andere  1968(2)  SA\n678(A);    Bellairs  v  Hodnett  and  Another  1978(1)  SA  1109(A),\n1148.\n\nProblems  of  retrospectivity  may  arise  in  relation  to  new\nConstitutions  as  they  do  in  relation  to  other  new  statutes.\nThey  arose  in  relation  to  the  introduction  of  the  Canadian\nCharter of Rights.  See R v Antoine (1983) 4 CRR 126.  In the\nSouth African Constitution express provisions obviate at least\nsome of the major problems of retrospectivity.   Section 4(1)\nprovides -\n\n\"This Constitution shall be the supreme law of the Republic and\nany law or act inconsistent with its provisions shall, unless\notherwise provided expressly or by necessary implication in this\nConstitution,  be  of  no  force  or  effect  to  the  extent  of  the\ninconsistency.\"\n\nSection 7(2), which is part of Chapter 3, provides -\n\n\"This  Chapter  shall  apply  to  all  law  in  force  and  all\nadministrative  decisions  taken  and  acts  performed  during  the\nperiod of operation of this Constitution.\"\n\nThese provisions mean that Chapter 3 prima facie has effect as\nfrom the commencement of the Constitution even if the result is\nto impair a vested right.  In that sense it is retrospective.2\n\n2     As Chapter 3 for the most part confers rights on individuals rather\nthan removes them there will not be many instances where retrospectivity in\n\n33\n\n\f \n[69]\n\n[70]\n\nKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nThe importance of section 7(2) is that it enables any person to\ninvoke  the  Constitution  as  a  protection  against  any\nunconstitutional official action taken against him or her, after\n27th April 1994, even if that action arises from that person's\nconduct before 27th April 1994.  On the other hand it follows\nfrom section 7(2) that official acts completed before 27th April\n1994 are not invalidated by anything in the Constitution.3\n\nIt is against this background that the purpose of section 241(8)\ncan  be  understood.    The  purposes,  I  suggest,  were  twofold.\nFirst, to ensure that Courts which had derived their power to\nhear  cases  from  the  old  Constitution,  could  continue  to  hear\nthem under the new Constitution.  Here I am in agreement with\nMahomed J, and broadly with the reasons which he has given for\nthat conclusion.  But that is not the only purpose of section\n241(8).    It  is  clear  from  the  language  used,  that  there  was\nanother purpose, and that was to ensure that there would be an\norderly transition from the old to the new legal order, so as to\navoid  the  dislocation  which  would  be  caused  by  introducing  a\nradically  different  set  of  legal  concepts  in  the  middle  of\nongoing proceedings.\n\nThere  is  no  warrant  for  reading  section  241(8)  as  merely\npreserving the territorial jurisdiction of the courts in pending\nmatters.    First,  the  sub-section  states  no  such  limitation.\nSecond,  sub-sections  (1)  and  (10)  of  section  241,  expressly\npreserve jurisdiction of existing Courts, in all proceedings.\nIf section 241(8) merely preserved  territorial jurisdiction in\npending cases it would be entirely superfluous.  The reliance\nwhich  some  judgments  place  on  the  proviso  is  in  my  opinion\nmisconceived.  The effect of a proviso is to except something\nfrom the preceding portion of the enactment which, but for the\nproviso, would be within it.  It cannot be construed as if it\nwere an enacting clause.  R v Dibdin [1910] P 57, 125;  Mphosi\nv  Central  Board  for  Co-Operative  Insurance  Ltd.  1974(4)  SA\n633(A), 645.  \"Pending proceedings\" include an appeal from the\noriginal proceedings - S v Thomas and Another 1978(1) SA 329(A).\nThe  proviso  to  section  241(8)  in  my  view  does  no  more  than\nensure that, notwithstanding the main enactment, appeals may go\n\nthe  sense  explained  will  arise.    A  theoretical  example  would  be  the\ninvalidation  of  a  statute  which  conferred  rights  on  a  section  of  the\npopulation on a discriminatory basis.  This might destroy the vested rights\nof those previously favoured.  \n\n3     For that reason it seems to have been unnecessary to invoke section\n241(8) in Kalla v Master of the Supreme Court, supra: the case could have been\ndecided in the same way be reference to section 7(2).\n\n34\n\n\f[71]\n\n \n\nKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nto appeal Courts other than those to which they would have gone\nunder the old law.  \n\nThe words in section 241(8), \"any court of law, including any\ntribunal or reviewing authority established by or under any law\"\nare  qualified  by  the  words  \"exercising  jurisdiction  in\naccordance with the law then in force\".  They lend weight to the\nview that, in the general context of section 241, sub-section\n(8) is concerned with the jurisdiction of the Courts seized of\npending  proceedings.    I  emphasise  \"jurisdiction\",  because\n\"jurisdiction\"  is  not  limited  to  \"territorial  jurisdiction\".\nThe term embraces territorial jurisdiction but in ordinary usage\nterritorial limits are only a part of what is meant by a Court's\njurisdiction.   The accepted meaning of \"jurisdiction\" is -\n\"a lawful power to decide something in a case, or to adjudicate upon\na case\".\n\nVeneta Mineraria Spa v Carolina Collieries (Pty) Ltd (in\nliquidation) 1987(4) SA 883(A), 886D.\n\nIt is -\n\n\" ... the power vested in a court by law to adjudicate upon, determine\nand dispose of a matter.\"\n\nEwing McDonald & Co Ltd v M & M Products Co 1991(1) SA\n252(A), 256G.\n\nIn Garthwaite v Garthwaite [1964] P 356, Diplock L.J. said at\n387 -\n\n\"In  its  narrow  and  strict  sense,  the  \"jurisdiction\"  of  a  validly\nconstituted court connotes the limits which are imposed upon its power\nto  hear  and  determine  issues  between  persons  seeking  to  avail\nthemselves of its process by reference 1) to the subject-matter of the\nissue or 2) to the persons between whom the issue is joined or 3) to\nthe kind of relief sought, or to any combination of these factors.  In\nits wider sense it embraces also the settled practice of the court as\nto the way in which it will exercise its power to hear and determine\nissues  which  fall  within  its  \"jurisdiction\"  (in  the  strict  sense)\n....\"\n\n[72]\n\nIf the broad purpose of section 241(8) is, as stated by Mahomed\nJ to be, \"to ensure that the jurisdiction of Courts to deal with\npending  cases  was  not  assailed  because  of  the  fact  that  the\nConstitution creates new Court structures with effect from the\ncommencement  of  the  Constitution\",  the  drafters  of  the\nConstitution would have to address two matters.  First, courts\nand  tribunals  would  have  to  be  empowered  to  continue  and\ncomplete pending cases.  Second, they would have to be told how\n\n35\n\n\f[73]\n\nKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nto deal with cases heard partly under one legal order and partly\nunder another.  They could have been told to deal with pending\ncases in the period after the new Constitution comes into force,\nin accordance with the provisions of that Constitution, or to\ndeal  with  them  as  if  the  Constitution  had  not  been  passed.\nRightly  or  wrongly  the  framers  of  the  Constitution  chose  the\nlatter  option,  and  we  are  required  to  give  effect  to  that\nchoice.\n\nWith all respect to the judges who have taken a different view,\nI find it difficult to see what other meaning can reasonably be\ngiven to the language used.  Even if the language were to be\nread, as Mahomed J suggests it should be, as \"a direction to\nproceed  with  pending  cases  as  if  the  Constitution  had  not\nimpacted  on  the  authority  of  the  pre-Constitution  Court  to\ncontinue to function as a Court ... [and] emphasizes ... that\nthe relevant Court must exercise jurisdiction in accordance with\nthe law then in force\", the conclusion would not in my view be\nany different.  The power of the Court in accordance with the\nlaw in force when it commenced the proceedings did not include\nthe power to strike down an Act of Parliament.  On the contrary,\nit was quite explicitly stated in section 34(3) of the Republic\nof South Africa Constitution, Act 110 of 1983 that no such power\nexisted.  The power to strike down such legislation comes from\nthe 1993 Constitution. It is, subject to section 101(6), a power\nwhich can be exercised only by this Court, but a challenge to\nthe  validity  of  an  Act  of  Parliament  can  be  raised  in\nproceedings  before  other  Courts  and  Tribunals.    It  is  only\npursuant to powers vested in the courts by the 1993 Constitution\nthat a challenge to the validity of section 217(1)(b)(ii) of the\nCriminal Procedure Act can be raised; but section 241(8) states\nin as many words that pending proceedings shall be dealt with as\nif that Constitution had not been passed.  Consequently, even if\nsection 241(8) is to be read as meaning that a court or tribunal\nbefore  which  proceedings  were  pending  should  exercise  its\n\"jurisdiction\" \"as if this Constitution had not been passed\",\nthe  result  would  be  the  same.    Its  jurisdiction  would  not\ninclude the constitutional jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme\nCourt under section 101(3), because such powers are derived from\nthe new Constitution, and did not exist under the old one. \n\n[74]\n\nEqually, I see no warrant for limiting the operation of section\n241(8) to the preservation of existing court procedure.  Again,\nthere  is  no  such  limitation  in  the  sub-section,  and  existing\n\"court procedures\" are expressly preserved by sub-section (10).\nNor  can  I  find  in  section  25  or  any  other  section  of  the\nConstitution any meaningful distinction between procedure and\nsubstance.  If the lawmakers had intended that those provisions\nof the Constitution which had a procedural character were not to\n\n36\n\n\f[75]\n\n[76]\n\nKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nbe applied in pending proceedings, whereas purely substantive\nprovisions were to be applied it would not be easy to find less\nappropriate  words  than  \"...  shall  be  dealt  with  as  if  this\nConstitution had not been passed\".\n\nThe  words  which  I  have  just  quoted  from  section  241(8)  echo\nwording used for over 100 years by legislators wishing to make\nit clear that new statutes did not affect pending proceedings.\nThus the Interpretation Act, 1957 (like the  Interpretation Act,\n1910  and  the  English  Interpretation  Act,  1889)  provides  in\nsection 12(2)(e) that the repeal of law shall not affect (inter\nalia)  any  right  or  obligation  accrued  or  incurred  under  the\nrepealed  law,  and  shall  not  affect  any  legal  proceedings  in\nrespect of such right or obligation, and such legal proceedings\nmay be continued \"as if the pending law had not been passed.\"\nSection 344(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 provides \n\n\"(3)    Notwithstanding  the  repeal  of  any  law  under  subsection  (1),\ncriminal  proceedings  which  have  under  such  law  at  the  date  of\ncommencement  of  this  Act  been  commenced  in  any  superior  court,\nregional court or magistrate's court and in which evidence has at that\ndate  been  led  in  respect  of  the  relevant  charge,  shall,  if  such\nproceedings  have  at  that  date  not  been  concluded,  be  continued  and\nconcluded under such law as if it had not been repealed.\"\n\nSimilar words appear in section 115 of the Magistrate's Courts\nAct 24 of 1944 (see Janover v Registrar of Deeds  1946 TPD 35)\nand in older statutes such as the Administration of Estates Act,\n1913.  See George Municipality v Freysen NO 1973(2) SA 295(C)\n300.  Such provisions have often been judicially applied.  It\nhas never been suggested that they relate only to territorial\njurisdiction  or  procedure.  See  e.g.  S  v  Thomas  supra;  S  v\nSwanepoel 1979(1) SA 478(A). \n\nAs far as I am aware the words \"shall be dealt with\", used in\nsection 241(8), are not found in the statutes to which I have\nreferred.  In those the words commonly used are \"continued\" or\n\"concluded\", or both.  In at least two cases in the Appellate\nDivision judges have used the phrase \"dealt with\" as synonymous\nwith \"continued\" and \"concluded\" as used in section 344(3) of\nthe  Criminal  Procedure  Act  and  section  12(2)(e)  of  the\nInterpretation Act. See S v Thomas supra at 334H; Pinkey v Race\nClassification  Board  and  Another  1968(4)  SA  628(A),  636C-D.\nThis accords with the ordinary meaning of the words.  \"Dealt\nwith\" is not a term of art.  The phrase is part of colloquial\nEnglish usage.  A judge, in ordinary parlance, deals with a case\nby  conducting  the  hearing  in  accordance  with  the  law  of\nevidence,  by  finding  the  facts,  applying  the  law  and  finally\npronouncing  the  decision.    More  shortly,  he  exercises  his\njurisdiction  in  the  general  sense  explained  above.    A  judge\n\n37\n\n\f[77]\n\n[78]\n\nKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nbound to deal with a case as if the Constitution had not been\npassed must exercise his jurisdiction as if the Constitution had\nnot been passed.   By contrast, a court does not \"deal with\"\nproceedings simply by retaining its territorial jurisdiction.\nThere is no basis in law, language or logic for giving \"dealt\nwith\" some different meaning in the context of section 241(8),\neven if a different meaning could be found.\n\nI  cannot  accept  that  the  words  \"dealt  with\"  are  words  of\nuncertain meaning.  According to the Oxford English Dictionary\nthe ordinary meaning of these words is \"to act in regard to, to\nadminister, handle, dispose in any way (of a thing)\".  In the\ncontext of section 241(8) these words quite clearly relate to\nthe conduct of a \"pending proceeding\" in the period after the\nConstitution has come into force.  There is nothing \"tentative\"\nor \"uncertain\" in the injunction that \"pending proceedings shall\nbe dealt with as if this Constitution had not been passed\"; nor,\nin my view, can these words reasonably be understood as meaning\nthat in the period after the 27th April 1994 courts and tribunals\nshould deal with pending proceedings in terms of the law then in\nforce.    On  the  contrary,  they  have  precisely  the  opposite\nmeaning.  \n\nThere are limits to the principle that a Constitution should be\nconstrued  generously  so  as  to  allow  to  all  persons  the  full\nbenefit of the rights conferred on them, and those limits are to\nbe found in the language of the Constitution itself.  Thus, in\nMinister of Home Affairs (Bermuda) v Fisher and Another [1980]\nAC 319 (PC) at 329E-F, Lord Wilberforce was at pains to point\nout that a constitution is a legal instrument, and that respect\nhas to be paid to the language used.  This was accepted in the\nunanimous judgment delivered by this Court in S v Zuma (supra)\nwhere it was said:\n\n\"We must heed Lord Wilberforce's reminder that even a constitution is\na legal instrument, the language of which must be respected.  If the\nlanguage used by the lawgiver is ignored in favour of a general resort\nto \"values\" the result is not interpretation but divination.\"\n\nThe existence of such limits is also recognised by section 4(1)\nof  the  Constitution  which  provides  that  \"...any  law  or  act\ninconsistent with [the Constitution's] provisions shall, unless\notherwise provided expressly or by necessary implication in this\nConstitution, be of no force and effect to the extent of the\ninconsistency.\"  (my emphasis)\n\nSection  241(8)  of  the  Constitution  provides  expressly  that\npending cases shall be dealt with as if the Constitution had not\nbeen  passed.    When  the  language  is  clear  it  must  be  given\neffect, and this has been stressed in cases in several different\njurisdictions.  See for example: S v Marwane 1982(3) SA 717(A)\n\n38\n\n\f[79]\n\nKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nat 749D-G; Bull v Minister of Home Affairs 1986(3) SA 870(ZSC)\nat 881E-H; Ex Parte Cabinet for the Interim Government of South\nWest Africa: In re Advisory Opinion in terms of S 19(2) of Proc\nR101 of 1985 (RSA) 1988(2) SA 832(SWA) at 853G; Tam Hing Yee v\nWu Tai Wai (1992) LRC (Const.) 596 (Hong Kong) at 600; Attorney-\nGeneral v Moagi 1982 (2) Botswana LR 124,184.    \n\nWith all respect to the judges who have taken a different view\nI find it difficult to see what meaning other than that which I\nhave suggested can reasonably be given to the language used.  \n\nIt follows that, although my reasoning is by no means identical,\nI  agree  with  the  conclusion  of  van  Dijkhorst  J  in  Kalla  and\nOthers v The Master and Others supra, BCLR at 88C, that section\n241(8) excludes the application of the substantive provisions of\nthe  Constitution  in  pending  cases.    The  courts  in  the\nconflicting  lines  of  cases  to  which  I  have  referred  have\nobjected that this interpretation would lead to anomalies and\ninjustices.  Thus in S v W and Others supra BCLR at 145H, Farlam\nJ  said  that  he  was  satisfied  that  the  framers  of  the\nConstitution  could  not  have  intended  that  cruel,  inhuman  or\ndegrading punishment could be imposed even in pending cases. \nIn Qozoleni v Minister of Law and Order and Another supra BCLR\nat  86D,  Froneman  J  asked  whether  the  Constitution  could\ncountenance  any  discrimination  based  on  race  even  in  pending\nproceedings, and answered his own question in the negative.  The\nexample has been suggested of two accused on the same charge,\nwith the indictment served on 26th April 1994 on the one and 27th\nApril 1994 on the other.  These apparent anomalies may arise in\nthe limited and reducing number of cases, civil and criminal,\nwhich were pending on 27th April 1994.  They are the inevitable\nresult of a transitional provision such as section 241(8).  Nor\nare they as serious as the examples given may suggest.  If it be\nassumed that a Court in some \"pending proceeding\" may have felt\ncompelled  to  pass  a  sentence  of  a  type  which  this  Court  may\nsubsequently  hold  to  be  cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading,  it\ncertainly does not follow that such sentence will be carried out\nafter such declaration has been made.  The carrying out of the\nsentence would be an unconstitutional executive act which this\nCourt would restrain under section 98(7) of the Constitution,\nand  no  court  would  knowingly  impose  a  sentence  which  cannot\nlawfully be carried out.  Issues arising out of racial or other\ndiscrimination in civil cases may involve questions of public\npolicy  which  would  depend,  not  on  the  enforcement  of  any\nConstitutional provision, but on public policy prevailing at the\ntime  the  case  is  heard.    See  Magna  Alloys  and  Research  (SA)\n(Pty) Ltd v Ellis 1984(4) SA 874(A).\n\n39\n\n\f[80]\n\n[81]\n\n[82]\n\nIn his judgment Mahomed J contends that if pending proceedings\nare to be dealt with literally \"as if this Constitution had not\nbeen passed\" a Supreme Court could not refer a matter to this\nCourt  in  terms  of  section  102(1)  because,  by  utilising  the\nprovisions of section 102(1) it would not in fact be dealing\nwith the proceedings as if the Constitution had not been passed.\nIn my view there is a twofold answer to this contention.  In the\nfirst place the Supreme Court in referring the matter to this\nCourt  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  section  102(1)  is  not\n\"dealing\" with proceedings,  it is seeking directions from the\nConstitutional Court as to how to deal with proceedings.  In the\nsecond place, even if the contention were correct, this would\nnot end the matter;  for this Court could still be seized with\nthe matter on appeal after the Supreme Court had construed the\nprovisions  of  section  241(8),  and  deal  with  the  matter  in\naccordance therewith.\n\nIt is in theory possible that as late as 26th April 1994, there\ncould have been a prosecution pending for the cotravention of\n(for example) a racially discriminatory local authority by-law\nwhich  had  somehow  survived  the  process  of  repeal  of\ndiscriminatory laws.   A conviction on such a charge after 27th\nApril 1994, would indeed seem to be extraordinary.  But it must\nnot  be  forgotten  that  the  courts  are  not  the  only  organs  of\nstate  bound  to  respect  and  enforce  the  Constitution.\nLegislative  and  executive  organs  of  state  at  all  levels  are\nsimilarly  bound  -  see:  sections  4(2)  and  7(1)  of  the\nConstitution.  In the hypothetical case envisaged it would be\nopen to Parliament or the appropriate Provincial legislature to\nrepeal  the  offending  by-law.      And  one  would  expect  the\nexecutive  in  the  person  of  the  Attorney-General  having\njurisdiction, to withdraw such a prosecution.        \n\nIt should be borne in mind that we are not concerned here with\nthe  meaning  of  rights  guaranteed  under  the  Constitution,  but\nwith  whether  guaranteed  rights  can  be  claimed  in  pending\nproceedings; nor are we concerned with a provision drafted with\n\"an eye to the future\", requiring it to be interpreted then in\nthe  light  of  changed  conditions.    Section  241(8)  is  a\ntransitional provision, intended to deal with a limited number\nof cases, covering a defined and comparatively short period of\ntime.  It is moreover a provision which has only limited and\nindirect  application  to  the  fundamental  rights  entrenched  in\nChapter 3 of the Constitution.  Chapter 3 governs acts performed\nand decisions taken after the Constitution comes into force, and\nthere will not ordinarily be such issues in litigation pending\non the date the Constitution came into force. \n\n[83]\n\nThe tension between Chapter 3 and section 241(8) is likely to\n\n40\n\n\fKENTRIDGE AJ\n\narise only in respect of the fair trial requirements of section\n25(3).  There will be anomalies in the conduct of trials which\nflow from what I consider to be the clear meaning of section\n241(8).  But there will also be anomalies flowing from the other\nconstructions that have been suggested.  The \"day before\" and\n\"day after\" anomalies exist where judgement has been reserved in\ncomparable  cases  and  is  given  either  immediately  before  or\nimmediately after the 27th April; the outcome of cases in which\nconvictions were correctly imposed before the 27th April on the\nbasis of presumptions later to be declared \"unconstitutional\",\ncould depend on whether appeals had or had not been noted, or on\nthe  dates  when  particular  appeals  were  set  down  for  hearing;\nproceedings could be disrupted because of the need on the 27th\nApril for unrepresented accused in part-heard cases to exercise\nrights under section 25(3)(e); witnesses may have to be recalled\nto  be  cross-examined  by  the  newly  appointed  counsel;\nprosecutions  based  on  partially  completed  cases,  involving\n\"unconstitutional presumptions\" may have to be re-opened to call\nevidence which had previously been considered to be unnecessary,\nand so on.  The point is that there are anomalies on both sides,\nand even if we were to think that the wrong choice was made, or\nthat on balance, there would be fewer or less serious anomalies\nif the framers of the Constitution had chosen differently, we\nwould not be entitled to depart from the clear language of the\nsection.  Nor is it strange, as some judges have suggested, to\nfind that this choice is set out in section 241(8) and not in\nChapter  3.    A  transitional  provision  is  precisely  where  one\nwould expect such a choice to be recorded, because the intention\nis not to limit rights generally, but to limit their application\nonly in respect of pending cases, affected by the transition.\n\nThe  reluctance  of  some  judges  to  give  literal  effect  in\nparticular cases to the language of section 241(8) is no doubt\nunderstandable. But I believe that the anomalies which disturb\nthem are the price which the lawmakers were prepared to pay for\nthe  benefit  of  orderly  transition  and  for  avoiding  the\ndisruption which would be caused by changing the applicable law\nin  the  middle  of  a  case.    In  the  same  way  existing  laws,\nalthough they may be held in due course to be unconstitutional,\nprima  facie  continue  to  have  effect  until  they  are  actually\nstruck down - see sections 98(6) and 229 of the Constitution.\nThe danger of regarding a text as necessarily having a single\nobjective meaning has already been adverted to in the Zuma case.\nI  am  also  fully  aware  that  it  is  a  Constitution  and  not  an\nordinary  statute  that  we  are  expounding.    One  of  the\ndistinctions between them is that a constitution is drafted with\nan eye to the future.  Another is that a constitutional bill of\nrights  should  as  far  as  possible  be  read  as  protecting\n\n41\n\n[84]\n\n\fKENTRIDGE AJ\n\nindividual rights, if necessary against the public interest.  I\nthus agree with the approach to constitutional interpretation\nfound in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Hunter\net al v Southam Inc. (1984) 9 CRR 355, at 364-5, and find the\nnarrow approach to the language of a constitution exemplified by\nGovernment of the Republic of Bophuthatswana and Others v Segale\n1990(1)  SA  434(B  AD),  especially  at  448-9,  unacceptable.\nNonetheless, there are some provisions, even in a constitution,\nwhere the language used, read in its context, is too clear to be\ncapable  of  sensible  qualification.    It  is  the  duty  of  all\ncourts,  in  terms  of  section  35,  to  promote  the  values  which\nunderlie a democratic society based on freedom and equality.  In\nthe  long  run,  I  respectfully  suggest,  those  values  are  not\npromoted by doing violence to the language of the Constitution\nin order to remedy what may seem to be hard cases.\n\nThis,  I  fear,  over-long  consideration  of  section  241(8)  is\nmotivated,  if  not  excused,  by  the  need  to  resolve  the\nconsiderable  conflicts  of  judicial  opinion  to  which  I  have\nreferred.  The immediate result of it is that in my view the\nretrospectivity which we gave to our ruling in the  Zuma case\nunder section 98(6) must remain limited to cases in proceedings\nwhich  began  on  or  after  27th  April  1994,  i.e.  which  were  not\npending  on  that  date.    We  cannot  override  section  241(8). \nSince this is a minority judgment nothing need be said about the\nform of order.\n\nChaskalson P, Ackermann J and Didcott J concur in the judgment\nof Kentridge AJ.\n\nKRIEGLER J: In another case argued contemporaneously with this\none,4  we  held  that  section  217(1)(b)(ii)  of  the  Criminal\nProcedure Act, 1977 is unconstitutional because it  assails the\nright of an accused to a fair trial.5  In this case the same\nquestion  arose  but  judgment  was  held  over  because  the  case\nraises the further question whether an accused whose case was\npending when the Constitution came into operation is entitled to\nthe benefits it confers.\n\n[85]\n\n[86]\n\n[87]\n\nThe  applicability  of  the  Constitution  to  cases  which  were\npending  when  it  came  into  operation  has  been  considered  in\n\n4     S v Zuma and Others 1995 (4) BCLR 401 (SA).\n\n5          The  offending  section  casts  the  onus  on  an  accused  in  certain\ncircumstances to establish the involuntariness of an extra-curial confession.\nThis was found to be an unwarranted infringement of the right to a fair trial\nguaranteed by section 25(3) of the Constitution.\n\n42\n\n\f[88]\n\n[89]\n\n[90]\n\nKRIEGLER J\n\nnumerous  cases  around  the  country.6    It  would  hardly  be  an\nexaggeration to say that the cases produced as many answers as\nthere  were  judgments.    The  present  case  runs  true  to  form.\nThere  is  manifestly  a  sharp  division  of  opinion  among  the\nmembers of this Court.  On the one hand Kentridge AJ, supported\nby three colleagues, has concluded that the benefits of chapter\n3 do not accrue to an accused whose case was pending on 27 April\n1995.    On  the  other  hand,  my  colleague  Mahomed  J,  with  the\nconcurrence of a number of justices, has come to the opposite\nconclusion.    Sachs  J  agrees  with  them,  but  for  different\nreasons.  Although I have come to the same conclusion as the\nlatter group and subscribe to the order formulated by Mahomed J,\nmy reasoning is somewhat different and ought to be recorded.\n\nIf one asks the wrong question, one is likely to come up with\nthe wrong answer.  And to my mind, the question in this case is\nemphatically not:  What is the effect of section 241(8) of the\nConstitution.  The correct question is as I have formulated it\nin the opening paragraph of this judgment.\n\nThere is universal consensus that the Constitution ushered in\nthe most fundamental change in the history of our country.  It\nmade everything new.  The country's national territory (section\n1), its national symbols (section 2), its languages (section 3),\nand  its  citizenship  (section  5)  were  created  anew.    The\nConstitution gave birth to a new legislature (chapter 4), a new\nexecutive (chapter 6), and a new judiciary (chapter 7).  More\nsignificantly, in the present context, it created justiciable\nfundamental  rights  and  freedoms  (chapter  3).    Above  all,  it\nestablished a constitutional democracy in which the Constitution\nitself was to be the supreme law of the land and would \"bind all\nlegislative, executive and judicial organs of state\" (section\n4).  It was a fundamental metamorphosis.\n\nThe aspect of that metamorphosis with which we are most directly\nconcerned is the recognition of fundamental rights and freedoms\nin  chapter  3.    That  chapter  recognises  for  every  person  a\ncomprehensive set of rights and freedoms enforceable in a court\nof law. It commences with section 7, which imperiously makes the\nchapter  binding  on  \"all  legislative  and  executive  organs  of\nstate\" and applicable to \"all law in force ... during the period\nof operation of this Constitution\".  In terms of section 251(1)\nof  the  Constitution  that  period  of  operation  commenced  on  27\nApril 1994.  It must follow that on that day every person became\n\n6     The law reports reflect no less than 18 cases reported up to March\n1995.  Several further cases did not make their way to the law reports.  The\ngist of these cases is discussed by Kentridge AJ.\n\n43\n\n\f[91]\n\nentitled to claim the rights and freedoms contained in chapter\n3.\n\nKRIEGLER J\n\ncame \n\nConstitution \n\nBut - say the proponents of the opposite point of view - that\nisn't so.  The benefits so unequivocally recognized for all with\neffect  from  27  April  1994  are  to  be  withheld  from  a  certain\ncategory.  Those accused persons whose trials were pending when\nthe \nand\nnotwithstanding the unequivocal language of sections 4, 7 and\n251(1), are not entitled to share in the bounty.  If otherwise\nqualified,  they  became  citizens  of  the  new  South  Africa,  owe\nallegiance to its new institutions, pay homage to its symbols\nand are eligible for office in the executive, legislative and\njudicial branches of the new state.  Nevertheless, they are not\nentitled  to  the  rights  and  freedoms  conferred  by  chapter  3.\nThat disentitlement is sought to be founded on the fact that\nthey were accused persons whose cases were pending.\n\noperation, \n\nsomehow \n\ninto \n\n[92]\n\nSuch a startling proposition surely calls for very convincing\nsupport  indeed.    But  the  sole  justification  is  found  in  the\nvague wording of an obscure subsection of a prosaic transitional\nprovision - namely section 241(8).  Although that subsection has\nbeen  quoted  time  without  number,  it  is  as  well  to  quote  it\nagain.\n\n\"All  proceedings  which  immediately  before  the  commencement  of  this\nConstitution  were  pending  before  any  court  of  law,  including  any\ntribunal  or  reviewing  authority  established  by  or  under  law,\nexercising  jurisdiction  in  accordance  with  the  law  then  in  force,\nshall  be  dealt  with  as  if  this  Constitution  has  not  been  passed:\nProvided  that  if  an  appeal  in  such  proceedings  is  noted  or  review\nproceedings with regard thereto are instituted after such commencement\nsuch proceedings shall be brought before the court having jurisdiction\nunder this Constitution.\"\n\n[93]\n\nIt is also as well to contextualize that subsection.  Section\n241  is  part  and  parcel  of  chapter  15,  titled  \u201cGeneral  and\nTransitional Provisions\u201d.  Save for section 229, which provides\nfor the continuation of existing laws until their repeal, and\nsection 230 (read with schedule 7) which repeals the panoply of\nBantustan  legislation,  the  chapter  has  nothing  to  do  with\nsubstantive law.  Section 231 keeps the country's international\ntreaties  extant  and  sections  232  and  233  deal  with\ninterpretation and definitions.  From there up to section 248\nthe chapter deals seriatim with the continuation of a variety of\nvital state functions.  Section 234 provides for the role of\nmembers of certain legislatures to come to an end but for the\nstaff of such bodies to remain in office.  Then sections 235 to\n238 make provision for the incumbents of executive authorities,\nthe civil service, and the Public Service Commission to continue\n\n44\n\n\f[94]\n\nKRIEGLER J\n\nfunctioning  until  replaced  by  their  successors.    Section  239\nprovides for continuity and order in the disposition of state\nassets and liabilities and section 240 for the continuation of\nthe State Revenue Fund.  Then follows section 241, which deals\nwith transitional and continuity arrangements for the judiciary,\nand  section  242  which  makes  provision  for  its  subsequent\nrationalization.    Sections  243  to  246  make  transitional\narrangements regarding the Ombudsman, the Auditor General, local\ngovernment  structures,  and  the  pensions  of  political  office\nbearers.    The  whole  pattern  of  the  chapter  is  manifestly  to\nensure orderly continuity of function and authority.\n\nThat, then, is the light in which section 241 is to be read.\nQuite logically it commences in subsection (1) with continuity\nof  the  judiciary.    This  is  done  by  the  simple  stratagem  of\ndeeming the existing courts to be the new courts constituted in\nterms of the Constitution.7  It is followed by three provisos and\ntwo  substantive  subsections  which  were  inserted  later.8    The\namendments were aimed at the orderly winding down of appellate\ntribunals that had been created in the former TBVC territories.\nSubsection (2), linking up with subsection (1), then deems the\nerstwhile Supreme Court judges to have been appointed under the\nConstitution.    We  therefore  have  continuity  of  courts  and  of\ntheir  judges.    Subsection  (3)  then  keeps  all  other  judicial\nofficers  in  their  posts,  subsection  (4)  does  the  same  for\nattorneys-general, while subsections (5) and (6) maintain their\nsalaries  and  pensions.    Judges,  magistrates  and  attorneys-\ngeneral of the old regime having been kept in office, subsection\n(7) requires them to take a fresh oath of office.  By-passing\nsubsection (8) for the moment, we see that subsections (9) and\n(10) are also concerned with continuity.  Subsection (9) allows\npending  legal  proceedings  against  a  government  body  to  be\ncontinued against any successor while subsection (10) keeps in\noperation for the time being all pre-existing laws relating to\nthe  jurisdiction,  procedures,  powers,  establishment  and\nfunctioning of courts of law and judicial officers.\n\n[95]\n\nViewed in that matrix, subsection (8) of section 241, despite\nthe equivocal nature of its wording, should hold no terrors.  It\n\n7     This was sensible because chapter 7, titled \"The Judicial Authority and\nthe Administration of Justice\", commences with the following provision:\n\n\"96.(1)  The  judicial  authority  of  the  Republic  shall  vest  in  the\ncourts established by this Constitution and any other law.\"\n\n8     By section 15 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Third\nAmendment Act, No. 13 of 1994.\n\n45\n\n\fhas  nothing  to  do  with  the  substantive  law  to  be  applied  by\ncourts.  It nowhere mentions law, substantive or otherwise.  It\ntalks of \"proceedings\", i.e. court cases, and seeks to organize\ntheir orderly and continued disposition.  More specifically, it\nis  concerned  with  proceedings  which  are  \"pending\"  when  the\nConstitution comes into operation, i.e. when the old courts die\nand the new courts are born.  With regard to such cases, part\nheard or still awaiting their initial hearing, the same question\narises:  Who deals with them now that the old courts have gone?\nAll the subsection says is that, notwithstanding the judicial\nmetamorphosis, all cases that were pending before the old courts\nare to be dealt with by those courts as if they had not been\nreborn.  The subsection does not purport to relate to the law to\nbe applied by any court, it merely designates the court which\nwill deal with the case.  The subsection is concerned with the\nadministrative \nhierarchical\ndisposition of cases that were on the rolls of courts of the old\nSouth Africa.  That is what the phrase \"any court of law ...\nexercising  jurisdiction  in  accordance  with  the  law  then  in\nforce\" denotes.  In other words, a proceeding \"pending before\nany court\" is to be \"dealt with as if [the] Constitution had not\nbeen passed\".  In the context, I suggest, there can be little\ndoubt  that  the  subsection  simply  and  only  means  that  the\ntribunal having jurisdiction under the old order has to  deal\nwith  a  pending  case.    Completely  logically,  the  proviso  then\nsays that an appeal or review from such new court (wearing its\nold  robes)  has  to  be  brought  to  the  new  superior  tribunal\ndesignated by the Constitution.\n\nchannelling, \n\nhandling \n\nand \n\n[96]\n\n[97]\n\nThere is no overlap between subsection (8) and any of the other\nsubsections of section 241.  Subsection (8) deals with pending\ncases only, says by whom they are to be heard and it alone deals\nwith that topic.  More importantly, though, there is no overlap\nbetween section 241(8) and any provision in chapters 2 or 3 of\nthe Constitution.  There is no tension between them.  Sections\n4, 7 and 251(1) confer rights on the individual and prescribe\nwhen they accrue.  Section 241(8) merely prescribes which courts\nare to dispose of those cases that had not been concluded when\nthe new Constitution came into operation.  \n\nEven assuming that there may be some tension between sections 4,\n7 and 251(1) on the one hand and section 241(8) on the other,\nthe  tension  should  be  resolved  in  light  of  the  qualitative\ndistinction  between  them.    They  deal  with  clearly  distinct\nmatters  of  fundamental  constitutionalism  and  recognition  of\nrights.    They  operate  at  a  wholly  different  level  than  does\nsection 241(8).  The \"international culture of constitutional\njurisprudence  which  has  developed  to  give  to  constitutional\n\n46\n\n\f[98]\n\nKRIEGLER J\n\ninterpretation a purposive and generous focus\",9 is applicable\nto chapters 2 and 3.  It has no place in the interpretation of\nsection 241(8).  The former are concerned with the broad brush-\nstrokes of the constitutional canvas.  Peer at them too closely\nand you lose focus, thus missing the picture.  The latter has a\nnarrow, technical and brief purpose and scope.  To understand\nand  correctly  apply  it  require  close  reading,  not  a  generous\nperspective.  \n\nThe ultimate conclusion to which I come is therefore, that no\naccused  person  whose  case  was  pending  on  27  April  1994  is\nprecluded  from  sharing  in  the  benefits  bestowed  by  the  new\nConstitution.  Such an accused is entitled to claim any one or\nmore  of  the  rights  conferred  by  chapter  3  and  the  presiding\nofficer is obliged to entertain such claim.  In particular the\naccused  in  such a case against whom a confession  had  already\nbeen admitted under section 217(1)(b)(ii) of Act 51 of 1971 is\nentitled  to  have  its  admissibility  reconsidered  without  the\napplication of that subsection by the court whether the decision\nto admit was made before or after 27 April 1995.  In terms of\nsection 98(6)(a) of the Constitution10 an order invalidating an\nact  of  Parliament  dating  from  the  previous  era  does  not\nautomatically invalidate anything done under such old act before\nthe declaration of invalidity.  However this Court is empowered\nto order otherwise if it is \"in the interests of justice and\ngood  government\"  to  do  so.    In  S  v  Zuma  and  Others,11  we\nexercised that power and effectively banned the use of section\n217(1)(b)(ii)  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  1977  in  all\nuncompleted cases which had commenced on or after 27 April 1994.\nIn my view a corresponding order should be made extending the\nprohibition to all criminal trials, whenever they commenced.  In\neffect, I therefore endorse the views expressed by Eloff JP in\n\n9     If I may quote the vivid description of Mahomed J in paragraph 8 of his\njudgment.\n\n10     Subsection 98(6)(a) reads as follows:\n\n\"(6) Unless the Constitutional Court in the interests of\njustice and good government orders otherwise, and save to\nthe extent that it so orders, the declaration of invalidity\nof a law or a provision thereof-\n\n(a)  existing  at  the  commencement  of  this\nConstitution, shall not invalidate anything done or\npermitted  in  terms  thereof  before  the  coming  into\neffect of such declaration of invalidity.\"\n\n11     Supra note 4.\n\n47\n\n\fKRIEGLER J\n\nJurgens v Editor, Sunday Times Newspaper, and Another:12\n\n\"... section 241(1) legitimates all courts of law existing at the time\nwhen the Constitution came into force.  Section 241(10) provides that\nall  measures  which  regulate  the  functions  of  courts  of  law  shall\ncontinue to remain in force until amended or repealed.  Neither of\nthese  subsections  deal  with  the  situation  where  proceedings  have\nalready commenced before a Court which has been legitimised and which\nis to continue to function in terms of existing legislative measures\nin terms of section 241(0).  The purpose of the first part of section\n241(8) is then to provide for the continuation of proceedings which\nwere pending on 27 April 1994.  The procedure then to be followed is\nthat prescribed by laws in force up to 27 April 1994, even though the\nnew Constitution may establish principles inconsistent with the old\nprocedure.\n\n\"It is in my view significant that section 241 hardly deals with\nsubstantive law; procedure and jurisdictional matters, and the status\nand  function  of  Judges  and  judicial  officers  are  in  general  dealt\nwith.  In that setting section 241(8) has to be seen and interpreted.\"\n\nI think the learned judge, in saying that the section \"hardly\"\ndealt with substantive law, was resorting to understatement.\n\nI  have  not  dealt  with  the  debate  concerning  interpretive\npresumptions regarding retroactivity and retrospectivity in the\ncase  of  statutory  amendments.    To  my  mind  the  adoption  of  a\nConstitution which operates as a supreme law does not fall to be\ninterpreted along such lines.  It is not a case of one statute\nrepealing, amending or replacing one or more others.  What we\nare concerned with here is a supreme statute being superimposed\non the whole of the existing legal landscape, bathing the whole\nof it in its beneficent light.  In the true sense of the words,\nit is not retroactive nor retrospective.  What it does mean,\nthough, is that the moment when the judicial officer has to deal\nwith a claim under chapter 3 he or she has to ask whether such\nright exists.  Moreover, if the particular right or claim had\nalready been disposed of in an interlocutory order made before\nthe Constitution came into operation, such ruling would have to\nreconsidered  thereafter.    If,  in  the  instant  case,  the\nprosecution  had  tendered  the  confessions  and  they  had  been\nadmitted under the authority of section 217(1)(b)(ii) prior to\n27 April 1994, the presiding judge would have had to reverse\nsuch ruling if a claim for such reversal were made after that\ndate but prior to verdict.\n\n[99]\n\n[100]\n\nTo sum up:\n1.\n\nI  agree  with  Kentridge  AJ  (paragraphs  49-58  of  his\n\n12     1995 (1) BCLR 97 at 102H-103B (W). \n\n48\n\n\fKRIEGLER J\n\njudgment) that the referral in the instant case was not legally\ncompetent.\n\n2.\nI  also  agree  with  his  view  (paragraphs  59-61  of  his\njudgment)  that  the  possible  effect  of  section  241(8)  of  the\nConstitution  is  of  such  public  importance  that  we  ought  to\nconsider and determine the issue.\n3.\nI  disagree  with  the  conclusion  regarding  the\ninterpretation  of  section  241(8)  reached  by  Kentridge  AJ  and\nagree with that of Mahomed and Sachs JJ, although for different\nreasons.\n4.\nThe  essence  of  my  deviation  from  the  reasoning  of\nMahomed J is that I ascribe a more mundane function to section\n241(8) than he does.  I agree with him that the creation of the\nnew courts, despite - and possibly to an extent because of - the\nPhoenix-like  emergence  of  the  old  judiciary  in  new  feathers,\ngave rise to the risk of a gap being perceived between the old\nand the new.  However, as I see it, that risk is fully met by\nsubsections (1) to (3) and (10) of section 241.  Subsection (8)\nserves merely to designate the fora to deal with pending cases.\n5.\nI  agree  with  Sachs  J  that  different  parts  of  the\nConstitution need to be read with different spectacles.  I do\nnot  agree  with  him,  however,  that  section  241(8)  is  to  be\ncontrasted  with  or  evaluated  against  chapter  3.    On  my\ninterpretation  they  have  entirely  different  fields  of\napplication.  They are not in conflict; on the contrary, they\nsupplement one another, each in its own field.\n6.\n I share with Mahomed and Sachs JJ a profound disbelief\nthat  the  framers  of  the  Constitution  could  conceivably  have\npurported  to  give,  with  one  hand,  the  fundamental  rights  and\nfreedoms  to  all,  only,  surreptitiously  with  the  other,  to\nwithhold its benefits from the many thousands of persons whose\ncriminal cases must have been pending on 27 April 1994.13\n\n[101]\n\nI therefore agree with the order formulated by Mahomed J.\n\n[102]\n\nSACHS J:  I share with Mahomed J a disbelief that the framers of\nthe  Constitution  intended  a  reading  of  section  241(8)  which\nwould  produce  the  anomalous  and  unjust  results  to  which  he\nrefers.    I  agree  with  his  conclusion  and  with  the  order  he\nproposes.    I  arrive  there  by  a  different  route,  however,  and\nbecause the issue of how to interpret our Constitution is one of\n\n13     The various criminal courts in the country deal with more than 2,5\nmillion cases each year.  It can safely be postulated that the number of cases\nthat were pending when the Constitution came into operation ran to tens of\nthousands.\n\n49\n\n\f[103]\n\n[104]\n\n[105]\n\nKRIEGLER J\n\ngeneral importance, I will set out my reasons in some detail. \n\nAlmost all discussion on the subject has been dominated by the\nidea that the issue is how to construe section 241(8).  In my\nview, this is an incorrect starting point which leads to a false\njourney.  The real question is not what meaning to give to that\nprovision on its own, but how to interpret it in relation to the\nenjoyment of Fundamental Rights as set out in Chapter 3.  This\nmeans  that  not  one  but  two  sets  of  provisions  must  be\ninterpreted,  not  consecutively  and  independently,  but\nsimultaneously and in terms of their inter-relationship.\n\nI have had the advantage of reading lucid judgments by Kentridge\nAJ  and  Mahomed  J,  each  persuasively  presented  within  its\ninterpretive  framework.    The  caveats  that  each  introduces,\nresult  in  outcomes  that  are  not  all  that  far  apart.\nUnfortunately,  I  am  unable  to  concur  unreservedly  in  either\njudgment.\n\nMy disagreement with Kentridge AJ's judgment is that even if it\nbases itself on the most natural and spontaneous reading of the\nsection, it gives far too little weight to the overall design\nand  purpose  of  the  Constitution,  producing  results  which  the\nframers  could  never  have  intended.  My  difference  with  the\njudgment of Mahomed J, on the other hand, stems from the feeling\nthat it unnecessarily strips section 241(8) of its more obvious\nmeaning, when the overall intent of the framers, as manifested\nby  the  Constitution  as  a  whole,  can  most  satisfactorily  be\nacknowledged by accepting the 'first sight' reading proposed by\nKentridge AJ, but cutting back its full application in order to\naccommodate  the  equally  clear  and  peremptory  provisions  of\nChapter 3.\n\n[106]\n\n[107]\n\nMy approach is accordingly similar in spirit and outcome to that\nof Mahomed J, but different in methodology.  Instead of seeing\nChapter 3 as a contextual aid to the interpretation of section\n241(8),  I  regard  it  as  an  equal  part  of  the  text  to  be\ninterpreted.  In my view, the issue is how to reconcile the two\nsets of provisions when they collide with each other, not how to\ninterpret each on its own. \n\nThe  cases  come  before  us  in  terms  of  Chapter  3,  not  section\n241(8).  In practical terms, the issue is never how to  construe\nsection 241(8) as an independent clause, but how to apply it as\na provision which qualifies another section of the Constitution.\nThis means that the two sets of provisions must be read together\nas part of the total constitutional scheme, not separately as\n\n50\n\n\f[108]\n\nSACHS J\n\nautonomous, free standing-clauses.14   If there is overlap and\ncollision of material between the two provisions, the essential\npurposes  of  each  must  be  discerned  and  weighed,  so  that  an\nappropriate resolution based on balance between the two can be\nachieved.    This  involves  a  species  of  interactive\nproportionality.  It moves the nature of the enquiry from the\nso-called plain meaning of words looked at on their own, or even\nin context, to the interactive purposes of different provisions,\nread together.15\n\nDiscord  and  dissonance  have  their  role  to  play  in  law  as  in\nmusic.  To be justified, however, they should not be accidental,\nbut  intended,  not  unfortunate  but  purposeful.  A  textual\nconstruction which harmonizes different provisions within the\noverall design of the Constitution is generally to be preferred\nto one which, however coherent within its own terms, produces\ndisharmony. There are indeed many provisions in the Constitution\nwhere it is clear that, for reasons of inclusivity, compromise\nand  smooth  transition,  special  arrangements  were  made  and\nparticular textures were introduced, not all of them obviously\nconsistent  with  the  broad  general  principles  of  the\nConstitution.  These would include the so-called sunset clauses\nand provisions introduced on behalf of special interest groups.\nFor the purposes of the present discussion, it is not necessary\nto identify them.  In each case, the wording and the purpose go\ntogether:    the  provisions  were  inserted  to  deal  with  special\ncases and special situations, and to go back on them would be to\nundermine finely honed texts of exceptional import to particular\nsections of the community.  In these cases, any departure from\nthe  text  produced  by  reference  to  other  sections  of  the\nConstitution,  and  any  consequent  strained  interpretation  or\ncutting down or extension of words, would require very strong\nand compelling contextual justification indeed. \n\n[109]\n\nSection 241(8) is of a totally different order.  Its function is\nto be functional.  It is not there to protect any particular\ninterest, or to develop any constitutional principle, or even\nnuance.  It is as technical and dry a provision as one can get;\nfar  from  being  one  of  the  letters  of  the  constitutional\nalphabet, it is at most a dot on the 'i' or a cross on the 't'.\nThe reason why so many judges have resorted to so many strained\n\n14     See Cachalia et al Fundamental Rights in the New Constitution Juta\n1994 Chapter 1 especially at p5.\n\n15     See Du Plessis and Corder, Understanding South Africa's Transitional\nBill of Rights, Juta 1994 Chapter 3.\n\n51\n\n\f[110]\n\n[111]\n\nSACHS J\n\ninterpretations of its text16 is that they simply cannot credit\nthat  such  a  puny  provision  should  be  able  to  annihilate  the\npowerful provisions that make up the heart of the constitution.\nSection 241(8) David takes on Chapter 3 Goliath, but this time\nit  is  Goliath  who  is  the  righteous  one.    Incredulity,  if\nconstitutionally and not subjectively based, should be a strong\nfactor  in  the  process  of  interpretive  choice.  It  credits  the\nframers with firmness of purpose and frailty of means, rather\nthan frailty of purpose and firmness of means. \n\nThe rights enshrined in Chapter 3, on the other hand, are deeply\nentrenched, not only in relation to Parliament, but in respect\nof the rest of the Constitution.  In my view, the strength of\nthe  Chapter  3  rights  and  the  intensity  of  the  values  they\npromote are central to the whole constitutional scheme, and are\nfundamental to our role as defenders of the constitution.  They\nlink up directly with the oath we recently took to 'uphold and\nprotect  the  Constitution  of  the  Republic  and  the  fundamental\nrights entrenched therein and in so doing administer justice to\nall  persons  alike'  [Schedule  3].    Only  the  most  compelling\nlanguage  would  justify  a  departure  from  such  a  clear\nresponsibility.    The  meaning  of  these  words  could  not  be\nplainer.    Even  on  the  literalist  extreme  of  the\nliteralist/purposive continuum, one is bound to ask what happens\nwhen  two  sets  of  plain  meaning  come  into  conflict  with  each\nother, that of Chapter 3 on the one hand, and that of section\n241(8), on the other?\n\nThe introduction of fundamental rights and constitutionalism in\nSouth  Africa  represented  more  than  merely  entrenching  and\nextending existing common law rights, such as might happen if\nBritain adopted a Bill of Rights.  The Constitution introduces\ndemocracy and equality for the first time in South Africa.  It\nacknowledges  a  past  of  intense  suffering  and  injustice,  and\npromises  a  future  of  reconciliation  and  reconstruction.    It\nembodies compromise in the form a Government of National Unity,\nand orderly reconstruction of the constitutional order in terms\nof  the  two-phase  process  of  constitution-making  which  it\nprovides  for.    It  is  a  momentous  document,  intensely  value-\nladen.  To treat it with the dispassionate attention one might\ngive to a tax law would be to violate its spirit as set out in\nunmistakably plain language.  It would be as repugnant to the\nspirit,  design  and  purpose  of  the  Constitution  as  a  purely\ntechnical, positivist and value-free approach to the post-Nazi\n\n16          The  different  'plain  meanings'  are  summarised  in  Kentridge  AJ's\njudgment.\n\n52\n\n\f[112]\n\n[113]\n\nSACHS J\n\nConstitution in Germany would have been.17\n\nThe Preamble in particular should not be dismissed as a mere\naspirational and throat-clearing exercise of little interpretive\nvalue.  It connects up, reinforces and underlies all of the text\nthat follows.  It helps to establish the basic design of the\nConstitution and indicate its fundamental purposes.18 (See too\nthe  concluding  passages)19    This  is  not  a  case  of  making  the\nConstitution mean what we like,20 but of making it mean what the\nframers wanted it to mean; we gather their intention not from\nour subjective wishes, but from looking at the document as a\nwhole.21\n\nOne way of dealing with the two sets of mutually contradictory\nprovisions would be to apply a variant of the presumption to the\neffect  that  general  provisions  do  not  trump,  override  or\nderogate  from  specific  ones.    [Generalia  specialibus  non\nderogant  -  general  provisions  do  not  derogate  from  special\nprovisions].    This  is  normally  applied  when  a  new  statute\ncontaining  general  words  is  applied  to  an  old  statute  with\nspecific provisions that are not expressly repealed.22  In the\nleading English case of The Vera Cruz Lord Selborne said:\n\n\"Now if anything is certain it is this, that where there are general\nwords in a later Act capable of reasonable and sensible application\nwithout extending them to subjects specially dealt with by earlier\nlegislation, you are not to hold that earlier and special legislation\nindirectly repealed, altered, or derogated from merely by force of\nsuch general words, without any indication of a particular intention\nto do so.\"23 \n\n17     Davis, Chaskalson and de Waal in Rights and Constitutionalism ed van\nWyk, Dugard, de Villiers and Davis, Juta 1994 at p85.\n\n18     c/f Manfred Nowak,  U.N.

The\ntechnical difficulty would be to decide which was general and\nwhich  specific:    Chapter  3  has  a  specific  ambit  but  is  of\ngeneral application; section 241(8) is said to have unlimited\nambit,  but  has  only  specific  application.  Perhaps  the  answer\nwould  be  to  allow  what  was  specific  from  each  to  survive,\nnamely, the specific ambit of Chapter 3 to co-exist with the\nspecific application of section 241(8).  Although I would regard\nthe  result  as  satisfactory,  the  means  are  artificial  and  if\nemployed  in  other  cases  could  lead  to  serious  constitutional\ndeformation.  \n\nIn  any  event,  a  question  mark  has  to  be  placed  over  the\nusefulness  of  common  law  presumptions  in  interpreting  the\nConstitution.  As Wilson J pointed out in a notable dissent,24\n'such  presumptions  can  be  inconsistent  with  the  purposive\napproach to Charter interpretation which focuses on the broad\npurposes  for  which  the  rights  were  designed  and  not  on\nmechanical  rules  which  have  traditionally  been  employed  in\ninterpreting detailed provisions of ordinary statutes in order\nto discern legislative intent'.  Sir Rupert Cross suggests that\neven in relation to ordinary statutes, the increasing use of a\npurposive approach makes the role of presumptions 'necessarily\nless  important  than  in  the  days  of  more  literal\ninterpretation'.25\n\n[116]\n\nThe preferred approach, as I have indicated, is not to search\nfor what is general and what is specific, but rather to seek out\nthe  essential  purposes  and  interest  to  be  served  by  the  two\ncompeting  sets  of  provisions,  and  then,  using  a  species  of\nproportionality, balance them against each other.  The objective\nis to achieve appropriate weight for each and preserve as much\nas  possible  of  both.    To  extend  the  analogy,  there  are  no\ntrumps, but there are cards of higher and lower value. \n\n[117]\n\nAnother way of dealing with the tension between Chapter 3 and\nsection  241(8)  would  be  to  regard  Chapter  3  as  part  of  the\ncontext  in  which  section  241(8)  is  to  be  construed,  and,\napplying a purposive approach to interpretation, cut back the\nwide  meaning  of  the  section  so  as  to  avoid  anomalies  and\n\n24     Thomson Newspapers v Canada 67 DLR (4th) 161 at p192.\n\n25     At p189-90.\n\n54\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nincongruities which the framers could never have intended.  A\nwell-known South African example of where 'the true intention'\nof the legislature, as determined by the context, was used to\ncut down the wide language of a provision is R v Venter.26  The\ntext under consideration in that case provided that 'any person\nentering [the Transvaal] shall be guilty of an offence ..... if\nhe has been convicted elsewhere .... of .... theft'.  The court\nheld  that  the  words  'any  person'  could  not  be  given  their\nordinary  full  meaning,  since  this  would  result  in  Transvaal\nresidents returning to the colony being guilty of an offence,\nwhen the context of the statute made it clear that the mischief\naimed at was the influx of criminals from abroad.  Innes CJ said\nthat 'the court may depart from the ordinary effect of the words\nto  the  extent  necessary  to  remove  the  absurdity  and  to  give\neffect to the true intention of the legislature'.27  Both Innes\nCJ and Solomon J explain that their decision in that particular\ncase  to  depart  from  the  plain  meaning  of  the  statute  is  not\nbased on absurdity but on identification of the mischief aimed\nat, and the need to avoid repugnancy to the intention of the\nlegislature.  \n\nIt  is  true  that,  as  Dr  L.C.  Steyn  points  out28  the  Venter\nprinciple was subsequently watered down by most South African\njudges by restricting its operation to what was called a small\nclass  of  extreme  cases.    Yet,  as  Dr  Steyn  observes,  the\njudgments were not all one way, and the Roman Dutch Authorities\nstrongly  supported  the  approach  adopted  in  Venter  (he  quotes\nDonellus as saying that \" Die wil behoort nie die woorde te dien\nnie,  maar  die  woorde  die  wil.    By  die  sake,  gevalle,  tye  en\npersone wat nie deur die bedoeling van die wet gedek word nie,\nhou die wet ook op, en daar en tot die mate maak die woorde geen\nreg  uit  nie,  hoe  seer  ook  die  algemene  woorde  hulle  almal\nomvat\").29\n\n[118]\n\n[119]\n\nThe issue now is not whether the Venter principle should be more\nwidely applied in relation to the interpretation of statutes,\nbut whether the approach it adopts should be given appropriate\nscope in relation to the construction of the Constitution.

It is not really so alarming as it sounds.\nAll it means is that the judges do not go by the literal meaning of\nthe words or by the grammatical structure of the sentence.  They go by\nthe design or purpose which lies behind it.  When they come upon a\nsituation  which  is  to  their  minds  within  the  spirit  -  but  not  the\nletter - of the legislation, they solve the problem by looking at the\ndesign and purpose of the legislature - at the effect it was sought to\nachieve.  They then interpret the legislation so as to produce the\ndesired  effect.    This  means  they  fill  in  gaps,  quite  unashamedly,\nwithout  hesitation.    They  ask  simply:  what  is  the  sensible  way  of\ndealing  with  this  situation  so  as  to  give  effect  to  the  presumed\npurpose of the legislation.  They lay down the law accordingly.\"33\n\n[123]\n\n[124]\n\n[125]\n\nCross quotes Lord Wilberforce as denying 'the tired old myth'\nthat  English  judges  are  more  literalist  and  narrow  than\ncontinental courts, and goes on to say that at least nowadays,\njudges  in  England  adopt  a  purposive  approach  to  statutory\ninterpretation, rather than a narrow literal one.34 \"Of course\",\nthe book observes \"a literal approach need not be a particularly\nnarrow one - an unrestrictive construction of general words may\nbe  excessively  literal  and  insufficiently  purposive,  but  the\nusual charge under this head is one of narrow literalism\".\n\nThe general approach adopted by Cross is to urge the judges to\nfunction  in  an  unapologetically  purposive  fashion  and  not  be\nafraid to acknowledge that they can and do 'rectify' the text\nwhen the words used in a particular formulation defeat or go\nagainst the general purpose of the statute.  He argues strongly\nin favour of a contextual approach and quotes with approval the\nobservation  by  Viscount  Simonds  that  \"  ....  words,  and\nparticularly general words, cannot be read in isolation; their\ncolour and content are derived from their context\".35\n\nA purposive and mischief-orientated reading as against a purely\nliteral one, always involves a degree of strain on the language.\nIn  the  present  case,  the  strain  comes  not  so  much  from  a\ncounter-literal attempt to deal with inherent ambiguity of words\non their own, or from the need to cut back the meaning of open-\nended words, but from the tension of counter-posing the broad\nwords of limited application in section 241(8) with the narrower\nwords of wide application in Chapter 3.

I accordingly do not apply the  Venter\nprinciple as such, but rather what I consider to be the modern\nand appropriate judicial technique of proportionality.\n\nI realise that the approach I am suggesting is relatively new in\nSouth Africa, and involves a utilization of proportionality that\nis  a  little  different  from  its  normal  employment  in  other\ncountries.   Yet I find it particularly helpful in dealing with\ncases such as the present. \n\nWe are a new court, established in a new way, to deal with a new\nConstitution.    We  should  not  rush  to  lay  down  sweeping  and\ninflexible rules governing our mode of analysis.  We need to\ndevelop an appropriately South African way of dealing with our\nConstitution,  one  that  starts  with  the  Constitution  itself,\nacknowledges the way it came into being, its language, spirit,\nstyle and inner logic, the interests it protects and the painful\nexperiences it guards against, its place in the evolution of our\ncountry, our society and our legal system, and its existence as\npart  of  a  global  development  of  constitutionalism  and  human\nrights. \n\nIt  is  a  matter  of  public  record  that  the  approach  of\nacknowledging problems and seeking consensual solutions based on\na  fair  balance  of  interests,  played  a  major  role  in  the\nelaboration of the text of the Constitution; there seems to me\nno  objection  in  principle  to  applying  this  approach  to  its\nintra-textual  interpretation  as  well.    Although  the  two\nendeavours are quite different in nature, both are based on the\nnotion  of  using  a  balanced  approach  to  deal  with  competing\ninterests, so that there are no outright winners and losers.36\n\nI might add that I regard the question of interpretation to be\none  to  which  there  can  never  be  an  absolute  and  definitive\nanswer and that, in particular, the search of where to locate\nourselves on the literal/purposive continuum or how to balance\nout  competing  provisions,  will  always  take  the  form  of  a\nprincipled judicial dialogue, in the first place between members\nof  this  court,  then  between  our  court  and  other  courts,  the\nlegal profession, law schools, Parliament, and, indirectly, with\nthe public at large. \n\n[130]\n\nThe objective of my approach in the present case is to preserve\nthe essential functional core of section 241(8), while causing\n\n36     c/f Dugard op cit p381.\n\n58\n\n\f[131]\n\n[132]\n\n[133]\n\nthe minimum disturbance to the fundamental rights entrenched in\nChapter  3.    In  other  words,  instead  of  mechanically  applying\nsection 241(8) and then lamenting, ignoring or minimizing the\ninjustices which follow, the court gives effect to the gravamen\nof  the  section,  but  construes  it  in  such  a  way  as  best  to\nharmonize with Chapter 3 and so avoid needless incongruity and\neliminate unnecessary postponement of enjoyment of fundamental\nrights.\n\nFrom  its  wording  and  in  the  context  of  transitional\narrangements, section 241(8) makes eminent sense as a stop-gap\nmeasure  designed  to  prevent  undue  uncertainty  about  the\ncontinuity of ongoing court business.  It simultaneously serves\nto establish the legitimacy of the judicial order and to deal\nwith cases that have already started in a manner which minimises\ndisruption.    It  also  functions  to  remove  unfair  prejudice  in\nrelation  to  people  who  had  already  instituted  proceedings  to\nvindicate their rights under the law as it stood.  It obviates\nthe necessity of having to start trials all over again from the\nbeginning,  insofar  as  the  courts  will  continue  to  have\njurisdiction  in  each  case.    It  means  not  only  that  what  has\nalready transpired need not be repeated, but that the validity\nof what was done before 27 April 1994 will be judged by the pre-\nApril 27 law. \n\nThese  are  worthwhile  and  uncontroversial  objectives  totally\nconsistent with the goal set out in the Preamble to provide for\nthe  restructuring  and  continued  governance  of  South  Africa.\nFurthermore,  the  provision  would,  in  my  view,  confirm  that\nproceedings already initiated before April 27 to secure then-\nexisting rights, would not be nullified.  None of the above is\nproblematic - in simple lay language, what was, was. (In this\nrespect I agree fully with both Kentridge AJ and Mahomed J on\nthe question of the non-retroactivity of Chapter 3.)\n\nA  straightforward  reading  of  the  section,  accordingly,\nconvinces  me  that  the  basic  objective  of  the  framers  of  the\nConstitution  was  to  provide  jurisdictional  continuity  and\nprevent operational chaos.  In order to do so, they employed,\nwith minor modifications, a well-worn formula used extensively\nin statutes that gave new rights and imposed new liabilities.\nThe use of an off-the-shelf formula strengthens my view that the\nmatter was not specifically adverted to with full awareness of\nand  intention  to  achieve  the  drastic  and  incongruous  results\nwhich  will  be  referred  to  below.    Rather,  as  far  as  court\nbusiness was concerned, the objective was a functional one and\na functional clause was introduced to achieve it.  The reference\nto  pending  proceedings  should  be  interpreted  in  a  functional\nway, in the light of, and not in opposition to Chapter 3. \n\n[134]\n\nThere is nothing stated expressly or necessarily implied in the\n\n\f[135]\n\n[136]\n\n[137]\n\nSACHS J\n\ntext, save the open-endedness of the language used, to indicate\nthat the framers intended that this provision should lead to:\n\na denial of fundamental rights after April 27;\n\ndislocation  between  the  judicial  power  [to  impose  certain\npunishments] and the executive power [to carry them out];\n\nmaking the fundamental rights of accused persons dependent on\nfortuitous  factors  of  no  constitutional  merit  in  themselves,\nrelating to when the trial became a pending one; and\n\nrequiring  courts  to  engage  in  trivial,  time-consuming  and  at\ntimes  elusive  enquiries  into  such  fortuitous  factors  before\ndeciding on whether to acknowledge fundamental rights or not in\nthe particular case. \n\nOn the interpretation which I propose, none of these problems\narise  and  none  of  these  time-wasting  enquiries  should  be\nnecessary.  That is not merely a consequence of the purposive\nand proportionate interpretation but an element of it. \n\nEven  if  the  cases  are  relatively  few,  that  is,  they  only\npotentially  affect  some  tens  of  thousands  of  people,  and  in\npractice only relate to a few dozen people who have actually\nraised constitutional points, the impact can be quite severe.\nIt could affect whether or not to impose the death sentence,\ncorporal punishment and imprisonment for civil debt.  It could\ninvolve  a  court  convicting  someone  even  though  it  had  a\nreasonable doubt as to his or her guilt, and causing substantial\ninjustice by denying counsel to an indigent person.\n\nMahomed  J  has  dealt  trenchantly  with  these  incongruities  and\ninjustices.  I merely add that these are not hypothetical cases\nconjured up for the purposes of a classroom debate or a late\nnight television programme.  Each and every one of the above\nissues has come before this court.   In each case we have been\nhaunted - unnecessarily on my version - by section 241(8).  In\neach case, the rights of an accused person in a profound way\nstood  to  be  affected.    In  my  view,  the  potential  damage  goes\nfurther.  The narrow literal view [with its broad implications]\nof section 241(8) that divines its purpose from its words alone\nand  effectively  excludes  the  rest  of  the  Constitution,\nunderplays the symbolical importance that a decisive break with\nthe past has for millions of people, and flattens the resonance\nfor the public at large of the promise implicit in and the hope\ninspired by Chapter 3.\n\nConclusion\n\n60\n\n\f[138]\n\n[139]\n\n[140]\n\n[141]\n\nSACHS J\n\nThere are circumstances of transition where a certain measure of\nincongruity and even injustice is inevitable.  In the present\ncase, however, the incongruity flows not from the nature of the\nprocess  itself,  as  contemplated  by  the  framers,  but  from  the\nmode of interpretation, as adopted by sections of the judiciary.\nIf one applies a strict literal test of section 241(8) on its\nown, and if one believes as Lord Halsbury did a century ago,\nthat the lawmaker is an ideal person who never makes a mistake,37\nthen one might have no option but to accept that the framers\nactually  intended  the  above  consequences,  in  the  sense  of\ndeliberately casting the linguistic net as wide as possible so\nas to cover all these situations.\n\nEven  accepting  the  less  idealized  vision  which  I  am  sure  the\nframers  of  today  would  have  of  themselves,  there  could,  of\ncourse, be circumstances where the only correct interpretation\nwould be that section 241(8) must be taken to override Chapter\n3.  These circumstances would include the situation where it is\nclear  from  the  language  and  the  context  that  the  framers\nconsciously adverted to and accepted such a necessity.  If this\ndrastic  consequence  was  manifestly  the  inevitable  price  of\navoiding  judicial  disruption,  then  I  could  accept  that  the\nframers  contemplated  it,  made  their  calculation  and,  if  the\nexpression  is  not  too  undignified,  bit  the  constitutional\nbullet.\n\nYet it seems to me that there is no intrinsic reason why the\nfunctional  objectives  of  avoiding  unnecessary  disruption  to\ncourt  proceedings  cannot  be  harmonized  with  the  fundamental\nrights of Chapter 3 and with the protective jurisdiction given\nto this court in Chapter 7.  Put another way, there is no reason\nwhy the mischief of disruption to the administration of justice\nshould not be countered without producing the counter-mischief\nof nullification of the principles that lie at the heart of the\nconstitution. \n\n[142]\n\nIn reality, the language of section 241(8) is open-ended rather\nthan compelling on this score.  If the framers had intended a\nConstitution  which  in  effect bit off its own leg, they would\nhave  developed  a  text  that  left  no  doubt  of  such  a  drastic\nintention.  \n\n[143]\n\nThe  issue  in  the  present  case  cannot  be  reduced  to  one  of\ndeciding  which  interpretation  gives  rise  to  the  greater  or\nlesser  number  of  anomalies.    Rather,  we  must  discern  which\n\n37     Income Tax Special Purposes Commissioner v Pemsel (1891) AC 531 at 549\n\n61\n\n\f[144]\n\nSACHS J\n\nproduces  anomalies  most  at  variance  with  the  character  and\ndesign  of  the  Constitution.    In  this  respect,  functional\ndifficulties  will  count  for  far  less  than  what  I  might  call\n'fundamental rights' anomalies.  Practical problems can always\nbe dealt with in a practical way.  Rights are of a different\norder, and it is our duty to uphold them wherever possible.\n\nThe  approach  I  adopt  therefore  purposefully  applies  a\nrestrictive  interpretation  to  the  further  reaches  of  section\n241(8)  so  as  to:  balance  it  against  the  specific  rights\nguaranteed in Chapter 3; avoid incongruous results to which the\nframers had not adverted and which they could not reasonably be\nthought  to  have  intended;  obviate  consequences  that  are  not\nnecessary for the achievement of the objective the provision was\nintended to serve; and express rather than go against the intent\nof  the  Constitution  looked  at  as  a  whole.    In  relation  to\nChapter 3, my interpretation also involves a limitation, namely,\nto  its  reach  in  time,  in  the  sense  that  it  is  not  applied\nretrospectively to undermine the validity of proceedings up to\n27 April 1994, or to negate rights which had already accrued at\nthat date.\n\n[145]\n\nMore  specifically,  I  find  that  a  proper  interpretation  of\nsection 241(8) in its constitutional context requires that the\nphrase 'shall be dealt with' must be construed as if it stated\n'subject to the provisions of Chapter 3' and not as if it stated\n'notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 3'. \n\n[146]\n\nIn this way, the two sets of provisions are harmonized, and,  if\nI might put it that way, David and Goliath refrain from mortal\nstrife. \n\n62\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nCASE NO\n\nCOUNSEL FOR APPLICANTS\n\nCOUNSEL FOR RESPONDENTS\n\n:\n\n:\n\n:\n\nCCT/25/94\n\nA E POTGIETER\n\n(PRO DEO)\n\nJ W S DE VILLIERS\nJ H DU PLESSIS\nI STRETCH\n\nINSTRUCTED BY\n\n:\n\nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL: NATAL\n\n63\n\n\f"}, "id": "cc537443-c91d-47fd-b26a-87adc0630c5f", "update_date": "2021-03-15 17:08:56.815453", "year": "1995"}, {"title": "S v Vermaas, S v Du Plessis (CCT1/94, CCT2/94) [1995] ZACC 5; 1995 (3) SA 292 ; 1995 (7) BCLR 851 (CC) (8 June 1995)", "url": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1995/5.html", "summary_document": null, "judgement_document": {"filename": "judgement-for-case-5.rtf", "file_url": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1995/5.rtf", "file_content": "CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA\n\nTHE STATE\nversus\nWESSEL ALBERTUS VERMAAS \nCase CCT 1/94\n\nTHE STATE\nversus\nJOHAN PETRUS LAFRAS DU PLESSIS  \nCase CCT 2/94\n\nHeard on 28 February 1995\nDecided on 8 June 1995 \n\n\n\n        \nJUDGMENT\n\nDIDCOTT J:\n\n[1]     \n A question that came to the fore in recent years, sparking a lively controversy in our law, was whether persons standing trial on criminal charges who could not afford to pay for their legal representation were entitled to be provided with it at public expense once its lack amounted to a handicap so great that to try them on their own lay beyond the pale of justice. The controversy, one marked by such cases as S v Khanyile and Another 1988(3)SA 795(N), S v Davids; S v Dladla 1989(4)SA 172(N) and S v Rudman and Another; S v Mthwana 1992(1)SA 343(A), has been settled decisively by our new Constitution (Act 200 of 1993), section 25(3)(e) of which declares that :\n        \nPg. 2/\"Every ......\n        \nPage 2\n\n\n\n\"Every accused person shall have the right to a fair trial, which shall include the right .... to be represented by a legal practitioner of his or her choice or, where substantial injustice would otherwise result, to be provided with legal representation at state expense, and to be informed of these rights\".\n\n[2]     \n We now have before us for simultaneous adjudication the cases of Vermaas and \nDu Plessis, where the right thus proclaimed has been invoked in circumstances rather different from those that were generally envisaged while the controversy lasted and we might have expected to encounter when such a matter first appeared on our agenda. For a trial of huge dimensions is a feature of each case, exacerbating the difficulties of both providing legal representation and proceeding with none.\n\n[3]     \n The two cases emanate from the Transvaal Provincial Division of the Supreme \n Court. Both trials are already in progress there, that of Vermaas before Kirk-Cohen J and the one of Du Plessis before Hartzenberg J. Vermaas faces 140 charges, some of theft, many of fraud and the rest laid under fiscal or commercial legislation. Du Plessis is alleged to have committed 63 offences, fraud on 62 counts and corruption on one. To every charge they each pleaded not guilty.\n\n[4]     \n The trial of Vermaas commenced in August 1991 and, after its interruption by \nnumerous adjournments, reached the stage during March 1994 at which the testimony on both sides and the arguments of the prosecuting team had been completed. It was then adjourned once more so that Vermaas might prepare the argument which he proposed to advance in his\nPg. 3/defence....\n\nPage 3\n\n\ndefence. By then no lawyer appeared for him. A series of advocates had done so at most earlier phases of the trial, but they had either withdrawn or been dismissed from it in turn because of problems that had arisen, mainly financial. The proceedings were resumed in May 1994, when Vermaas started addressing the court on a record of the oral evidence presented and the documentary exhibits produced which amounted in bulk to about 40 000 pages. Changing tack, however, he applied during June 1994 for an order directing that throughout the remainder of the trial he be furnished with legal representation at the cost of the state. Kirk-Cohen J dealt with the application in a judgment that was delivered on 14 June 1994 and has been reported under the heading of S v Vermaas 1994(4)BCLR 18(T).\n\n[5]     \n The trial of Du Plessis got under way during June 1993. It was also adjourned \nfrom time to time, and has not gone very far. The only testimony already adduced consists of some taken overseas on commission and that elicited from a number of witnesses for the prosecution whose evidence-in-chief was led locally but who have not yet been cross-examined.  The services of successive advocates were obtained by Du Plessis too and, through a shortage of funds, likewise lost. So in May 1994 he sought the same order as the one that Vermaas requested soon afterwards, claiming in addition the right to choose the particular lawyer whom he wanted the state to procure for him. The outcome was a judgment delivered by Hartzenberg J on 19 May 1994, which has been reported as well and, owing to the presence in the case of a co-accused, is cited as S v Lombard en 'n Ander 1994(3)SA 776(T); 1994(2) SACR 104(T).\nPg. 4/ Each....\n\nPage 4\n\n[6]     \n Each trial started well before the Constitution came into operation on 27 April \n1994. Whether section 25(3)(e) governed its future conduct in that situation was a question which had to be considered prior to the merits of either application. The issue arose because section 241(8) decreed that :\n\n\"All proceedings which immediately before the commencement of this Constitution were pending before any court of law ...., exercising jurisdiction in accordance with the law then in force, shall be dealt with as if this Constitution had not been passed ....\"\n\nBoth judges thought that the question should be answered in the negative. To obtain certainty on the point, however, they referred the issue to us, together with the merits in the event of our taking the opposite view. For the time being the trials were adjourned again.\n\n[7]     \n A further question, and a preliminary one, confronted us when the cases were\nargued here. It was whether the referrals had been, in themselves, constitutionally competent. Section 102(1) stipulates that :\n\n\"If, in any matter before a provincial or local division of the Supreme Court, there is an issue which may be decisive for the case, and which falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court in terms of section 98(2) and (3), the provincial or local division concerned shall, if it considers it to be in the interest of justice to do so, refer such matter to the Constitutional Court for its decision: Provided that, if it is necessary for evidence to be heard for the purposes of deciding such issue, the provincial or local division concerned shall\nPg. 5/hear....\nPage 5\n\n\nhear such evidence and make a finding thereon, before referring the matter to the Constitutional Court.\"\n\n Section 102(2) follows, going thus :\n\n\"If, in any matter before a local or provincial division, there is any issue other than an issue referred to the Constitutional Court in terms of sub-section (1), the provincial or local division shall, if it refers the relevant issue to the Constitutional Court, suspend the proceedings before it, pending the decision of the Constitutional Court.\"\n\nNone of the referred issues fell within our exclusive jurisdiction. So section 102(1) did not authorise the referrals that occurred. They purported to have been ordered under section 102(2), however, which each judge construed in such a way that it provided for a scheme of referrals distinct from and additional to the one sanctioned by section 102(1), a scheme allowing him in the middle of the trial to seek from us a ruling on a point that he was empowered to decide for himself.\n\n[8]     \n No reasons for that interpretation were furnished in either of the judgments \ndelivered at the time, the reported ones which I mentioned a moment ago. It seems on both occasions to have been regarded as a construction that spoke for itself. Marais J criticised it trenchantly in  S v Coetzee and Others 1994(4) BCLR 58(W) (at 64E - 67A); 1994(2) SACR 791(W) (at 798b - 800h). Hartzenberg J responded to the criticism in S v Lombard 1994(3) BCLR 126(T) (at 134C - 135F). Kirk-Cohen J and he then explained their reasoning in detailed\nPg. 6/expositions....\n\nPage 6\n\n expositions of it which they kindly let us have at the request of Chaskalson P.\n\n[9]     \n Such reasoning, to summarise it, went like this. Sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 102 both differentiated between a \"matter\" and an \"issue\".  The choice of those words was not fortuitous. The wording drew a deliberate distinction between an entire case, called the \"matter\", and a specific question arising in it, which was labelled as the \"issue\". Sub-section (1) provided for the referral to us of no limited \"issue\", but of the \"matter\" and accordingly of the case as a whole. No portion or aspect of it remained in the provincial or local division after the referral. So nothing had to be suspended there, and that accounted for the silence of the sub-section on the point. The \"matter\" or its residue would return later to the provincial or local division, if and when we remitted it to its initial forum. Sub-section (2), by comparison, dealt with the referral of a particular \"issue\" alone. The rest of the \"matter\" was left lying before the provincial or local division. The suspension of the proceedings there thus became necessary. The \"issue\" so referred, the one identified as \"the relevant issue\", was not any \"issue referred to the Constitutional Court in terms of sub-section (1)\", but some \"issue other than\" that, and therefore an \"issue other than\" the kind which lay within our exclusive jurisdiction. So much was demonstrated by the part going \"if it refers the relevant issue to the Constitutional Court\". The use there of the word \"if\", rather than \"when\", was apt in relation only to a referral which might or might not eventuate, at the discretion of the provincial or local division. None ordered under sub-section (1) could have been contemplated, since every such referral became compulsory once the provincial or local division found it to be in the interests of justice. Nor did \"if\" fit the bill of a referral predicated already. It introduced the hypothesis of one that had yet\nPg. 7/to....\n\nPage 7\n\nto be considered. The reasoning that I have outlined, I should add in parenthesis, is not attributable in all respects to each of the two judges. It serves well enough, I hope however, as a composite paraphrase of their individual views.\n\n[10]    \n My comments on all that are these. Too much was read, I believe, into the \nnuances of a \"matter\" on the one hand and an \"issue\" on the other. Nor is the usage of those words in section 102 quite as uniform or consistent as it was apparently thought to be. One notices that the \"matter\" referred for decision under sub-section (1) is called an \"issue\" in the proviso to it, and that sub-section (2) describes the subject of a referral in terms of sub-section (1) as an \"issue\" instead of a \"matter\". There at least, so it seems, the words are used synonymously and interchangeably. Nothing could emerge with greater clarity from sub-section (1) in any event, and however fastidiously it is analysed, than this. What we have to decide on a referral ordered under the sub-section is a specific \"issue\" falling within our exclusive jurisdiction which has arisen in the \"matter\" so referred, and not the \"matter\" in its entirety. To solicit a decision on an \"issue\" of that sort is the very purpose of any such referral, after all, and the only one. The sub-section recognises the restricted ambit of the enquiry when it directs the referring court to hear and make findings on any evidence needed \"for the purposes of deciding such issue\". The restriction stands to reason, furthermore, once one reminds oneself that the \"matter\" as a whole will frequently, indeed usually, raise other questions too that lie outside our province, those questions of fact and of general law on which the last word rests not with us but with the Appellate Division. I therefore consider that we must construe the word \"matter\", where it appears for the second time in sub-section (1), as if its place had been taken by\nPg. 8/\"issue\"....\n\nPage 8\n\n\"issue\", a notional substitution which is not out of tune with the text since a \"matter\" in its ordinary sense often denotes an \"issue\" and lends itself readily to that construction in a context suitable for such. Turning to sub-section (2), I express next my firm disagreement with the meaning ascribed to \"the relevant issue\". That \"issue\", as I read the wording in what appeals to me as the natural way, is the particular one \"referred to the Constitutional Court in terms of sub-section (1)\", not a separate and different \"issue\" arising in the \"matter\". I accept that, if I am right there, the sub-section would have been improved by the use of \"when\", rather than \"if\", at the start of the clause alluding to \"the relevant issue\". To set great store by the chosen word sounds, however, somewhat pedantic. The choice may safely be dismissed as a mere repetition, inappropriate perhaps, of the conditional phraseology employed in sub-section (1).\n\n[11]    \n Some further observations of mine concern not so much the wording contained \nin section 102 as several omissions from it. One would have expected to find three material provisions in sub-section (2), had it really been intended to establish its own system of referrals apart from and in addition to those ordained by sub-section (1). All three provisions are absent. Sub-section (2) lacks, in the first place, a clear empowerment of the provincial or local division to order such extra referrals, an empowerment produced explicitly like the one seen in sub-section (1), not left to be engendered by a process of dubious implication. The second omission is this. Sub-section (2) sets no test for the exercise of the power, either along the lines prescribed by sub-section (1) when it mentions the potential decisiveness of the point and the interests of justice or by the adoption of some other criterion or criteria. Nor, in the third place, does sub-section (2) echo the proviso to sub-section (1) by catering for evidence and findings on questions\nPg. 9/of....\n\nPage 9\n\nof fact. No less telling is a fourth omission, this time from sub-section (1) if my treatment of its text holds good. Directions which the sub-section does not contain are then needed, directions corresponding to those given in sub-section (2) for the suspension in the meantime of the proceedings before the provincial or local division.\n\n[12]    \n I accordingly conclude that sub-section (2) of section 102 does not in itself \nprovide for any referrals. It merely supplements sub-section (1) by regulating the procedure which the provincial or local division must follow in ordering a referral under that sub-section. The result is that no issue which the division has the power to decide may properly be referred to us while the litigation raising it remains in progress there. The judge hearing the case must determine the issue for himself or herself. It may be presented to us on appeal, should it fall within our field, when the litigation has ended in the court below. Or, in the special situation covered by section 102(8), the judge may refer it to us after disposing of the case. The referrals now before us were therefore, in my opinion, incompetent.\n\n[13]    \n The conclusion thus reached, we were warned in argument, would sometimes \nhave unfortunate results. A long and complicated trial might be vitiated in the end by an infringement of the Constitution that was first rated as such on appeal. All the time, effort and money expended on it would then turn out to have been wasted. The wastage could be avoided by seeking an authoritative ruling on the point as soon as the need for that became apparent, and by obtaining one while the opportunity still existed to comply with it or to repair any damage done in its absence. Such a course was opened by the construction which Kirk-Cohen J and\nPg. 10/Hartzenberg....\nPage 10\n\nHartzenberg J had placed on section 102(2). The answer, I believe, is this. The solution to the problem posed does not depend on that construction. It lies in rule 17(1) of our rules which was promulgated under section 100(2), a section stating that :\n\n\"The rules of the Constitutional Court may make provision for direct access to the Court where it is in the interest of justice to do so in respect of any matter over which it has jurisdiction.\"\n\nAlluding to the Constitutional Court simply as \"the Court\", rule 17(1) then provides that :\n\n\"The Court shall allow direct access in terms of section 100(2) of the Constitution in exceptional circumstances only, which will ordinarily exist only where the matter is of such urgency, or otherwise of such public importance, that the delay necessitated by the use of ordinary procedures would prejudice the public interest or prejudice the ends of justice and good government.\"\n\nThat, though framed narrowly, sounds like a formulation general enough to cater in appropriate circumstances for a situation of the sort postulated by counsel. True it is that, in contrast with a referral by the trial court, direct access has to be requested by a party to the proceedings. It seems to be a mechanism no less effective, however, on that account. The advantages of piecemeal adjudication, once they look strong in any given trial, will surely strike the parties, or one side at least, with a force equal to that felt by the judge. In a heavy criminal matter, for instance, the prosecution will be no more eager than he or she to run the risk of an abortive trial, and the defence no less anxious about its financial toll. Nor, even so early in the\nPg. 11/operation....\n\nPage 11\noperation of rule 17(1), is recourse to it unprecedented in a state of affairs comparable with the one that has now developed. I have in mind S v Zuma and Others 1995(4) BCLR 401(SA), where an application for direct access was made and granted so that an issue wrongly referred to us might nevertheless, and in the interests of justice, be determined here at once. Paragraph [11] of the judgment which Kentridge AJ wrote in that case explains why, and describes the special circumstances in which, direct access happened then to be allowed. The decision was not intended, I emphasise, to encourage a resort to rule 17(1) in any setting but the truly exceptional kind mentioned there. Worth repeating in that regard are some remarks passed by Kentridge AJ in paragraph [11] of another judgment that he has prepared, the judgment written in S v Mhlungu and Others which will be delivered simultaneously with this one. They have to do with referrals, but are no less pertinent to applications for direct access. What Kentridge AJ said on that occasion, which I underline because of its important bearing on constitutional litigation, was this:\n\n\"Where the case is not likely to be of long duration it may be in the interests of justice to hear all the evidence or as much of it as possible before considering a referral. Interrupting and delaying a trial, and above all a criminal trial, is in itself undesirable, especially if it means that witnesses have to be brought back after a break of several months. Moreover, once the evidence in the case is heard it may turn out that the constitutional issue is not after all decisive. I would lay it down as a general principle that where it is possible to decide any case, civil or criminal, without reaching a constitutional issue, that is the course which should be followed.\"\n\n[14]    \n In neither of the present matters was direct access sought in case the referrals were ruled out of order. How we would have reacted to such a request on this occasion, and in its\nPg. 12/circumstances....\n\nPage 12\n\ncircumstances, is a question that calls for no answer. The question is by the way, in any event, since the earlier uncertainty about the effect of section 241(8) will not be perpetuated by the failure to present us properly with that issue in these particular cases. It has now been dispelled by the definite and definitive interpretation given to the section in S v Mhlungu and Others, the one favoured by the majority of this Court. According to that, it transpires, Kirk-Cohen J and Hartzenberg J erred in believing the future conduct of their trials to be untouched by section 25(3)(e).\n \n[15]    \n That outcome shifts the spotlight onto the other issue put to us, the question whether Vermaas and Du Plessis were, or either of them was, now entitled on the strength of section 25(3)(e) to obtain legal representation at the cost of the state. There too, in my opinion, no answer should be ventured by us. I say that because, besides the incompetence of the referrals, we are ill equipped for the factual findings and assessments which the enquiry entails. Such a decision is pre-eminently one for the judge trying the case, a judge much better placed than we are by and large to appraise, usually in advance, its ramifications and their complexity or simplicity, the accused person's aptitude or ineptitude to fend for himself or herself in a matter of those dimensions, how grave the consequences of a conviction may look, and any other factor that needs to be evaluated in the determination of the likelihood or unlikelihood that, if the trial were to proceed without a lawyer for the defence, the result would be \"substantial injustice\". Kirk-Cohen J expressed some scepticism about the inability of Vermaas to present unaided an adequate argument at the end of his trial, observing that he was an attorney by profession who had displayed\nPg. 13/a....\n\nPage 13\na lively interest and taken an active part in the earlier management of his defence, while Hartzenberg J commented in passing on the personal position of Du Plessis. No firm or final conclusion appears to have been reached in either case, however, on the merits of the claim lodged under section 25(3)(e) if that turned out not to be hit by section 241(8). Kirk-Cohen J and Hartzenberg J will now have to consider the topic more fully and dispose of it one way or the other. A single point has already been decided by Hartzenberg J in that connection, which concerns the right claimed by Du Plessis to pick the lawyer appointed for him. Hartzenberg J held that no such right was derived from section 25(3)(e) when the state supplied the lawyer's services. That is certainly so. The effect of the disjunctive \"or\", appearing in the section immediately before the reference to the prospect of \"substantial injustice\", is to differentiate clearly between two situations, the first where the accused person makes his or her own arrangements for the representation that must be allowed, the second in which the assistance of the state becomes imperative, and to cater for the personal choice of a lawyer in the first one alone.\n\n[16]    \n A word or two had better be added, as I draw to a close, on a subject of public importance which prompted some discussion when the present cases were argued. No counsel on either side could then tell us of any steps taken yet to establish the financial and administrative structures that were necessary to give effect to the part of section 25(3)(e) providing for legal representation at the expense of the state. We gained the impression that nothing of much significance had been done in that direction since the Constitution came into force a year ago. The impression, if true, is most disturbing. We are mindful of the multifarious demands on the public purse and the machinery of government that flow from the urgent need for economic\nPg. 14/and....\n\nPage 14\n\nand social reform. But the Constitution does not envisage, and it will surely not brook, an undue delay in the fulfilment of any promise made by it about a fundamental right. One can safely assume that, in spite of section 25(3)(e), the situation still prevails where during every month countless thousands of South Africans are criminally tried without legal representation because they are too poor to pay for it. They are presumably informed in the beginning, as the section requires them peremptorily to be, of their right to obtain that free of charge in the circumstances which it defines. Imparting such information becomes an empty gesture and makes a mockery of the Constitution, however, if it is not backed by mechanisms that are adequate for the enforcement of the right.\n\n[17]    \n The cases of Vermaas and Du Plessis are both remitted to the Transvaal Provincial  Division so that their trials may be resumed and completed there.\n\n\n\nChaskalson P, Ackermann J, Kentridge AJ, Kriegler J, Langa J, Madala J, Mahomed J, \nMokgoro J, ORegan J and Sachs J all concur in the judgment of Didcott J.\n\n\nCounsel for Vermaas     \n        \n:       \n        \nC R Jansen and D Unterhalter\nCounsel for Du Plessis  \n:       \n        \nS C Jacobs\nCounsel for the State   \n        \n:       \n        \nJ A Swanepoel SC, D F de Beer SC, \nS C Jordaan and W H Moore\n\n"}, "id": "6536dd3b-ed98-40a6-84bc-6f50de34a861", "update_date": "2021-03-15 17:08:56.815479", "year": "1995"}, {"title": "S v Williams and Others (CCT20/94) [1995] ZACC 6; 1995 (3) SA 632 ; 1995 (7) BCLR 861 (CC) (9 June 1995)", "url": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1995/6.html", "summary_document": null, "judgement_document": {"filename": "judgement-for-case-6.pdf", "file_url": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1995/6.pdf", "file_content": "IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA\n\nCASE NO: CCT/20/94\n\nIn the matter of :\n\nTHE STATE\n\nversus\n\nHENRY WILLIAMS\nJONATHAN KOOPMAN\nTOMMY MAMPA\nGARETH PAPIER\nJACOBUS GOLIATH\nSAMUEL WITBOOI\n\nHEARD ON\n\nDELIVERED ON\n\n24 MARCH 1995\n\n9 JUNE 1995\n\n                                                                                                                               LANGA,  J:\n\n JUDGMENT\n\n[1]\n\nThis matter has been referred to this Court by the Full Bench of the Cape of Good Hope\n\nProvincial  Division  of  the  Supreme  Court  (Conradie,  Scott  and  Farlam  JJ).    It  is  a\n\nconsolidation of five different cases in which six juveniles were convicted by different\n\nmagistrates and sentenced to receive a \"moderate correction\" of a number of strokes with\n\na light cane.  The issue is whether the sentence of juvenile whipping, pursuant to the\n\nprovisions of section 294 of the Criminal Procedure Act,1 is consistent with the provisions\n\nof the Constitution.2 \n\n[2]\n\nMr. Bozalek appeared with Mr. Hathorn as amicus curiae on behalf of the accused; they\n\nwere assisted by the Legal Resources Centre's Cape Town office.  We are indebted to both\n\nCounsel and to the Legal Resources Centre.  Before the date of the hearing, the President\n\nof this Court was advised by the Attorney General of the Cape of Good Hope Provincial\n\n     1 Act No. 51 of 1977 (as amended). For convenience this will be referred to simply as \"the Act.\u201d \n\n     2  Act No. 200 of 1993 (as amended). For convenience, this will henceforth be referred to simply as \"the\nConstitution.\"\n\n\f2\n\nDivision that he wished to withdraw the argument which had been filed on his behalf (and\n\non behalf of the State) as he shared the view that the provisions relating to corporal\n\npunishment in section 294 of the Act were unconstitutional.  Mr. Slabbert, who is a\n\nmember of the Attorney General's staff, however agreed to present the opposing argument\n\nas amicus curiae in accordance with the written argument which had been filed on behalf\n\nof the State. We place on record our appreciation to him for having undertaken this task.\n\n[3]\n\nPurely for the sake of convenience, I shall refer to the accused as the applicants and to the\n\nposition adopted by Mr. Slabbert in his argument as that of the State. \n\n[4]\n\nAlthough each of the cases has a history of its own, much is in common.  The applicants\n\nare all males and they are all juveniles. Three of them, namely, Williams, Koopman and\n\nMampa were each sentenced to suspended prison sentences in addition to the juvenile\n\nwhipping.  The remaining three were sentenced to juvenile whipping only.  All the trials\n\nhad commenced before 27 April 1994; each of the sentences was passed after 27 April\n\n1994. \n\n[5]\n\nThe Provincial Division became seized of the matters in two ways: all five cases were\n\nsubject to automatic review in terms of section 302(1)(a) of the Act because of the terms\n\nof imprisonment, albeit suspended, imposed on the applicants themselves or on their\n\nfellow accused who do not feature in the present proceedings.  In addition to this, Mr. A.P.\n\nDippenaar who presided over the case involving Williams, requested that the sentence of\n\nstrokes be subjected to special review in terms of section 304(4) of the Act. He took this\n\nstep because he doubted whether juvenile whipping was a permissible punishment in the\n\nlight of the provisions of the Constitution and in view of the decision in Ex Parte Attorney-\n\nGeneral, Namibia: In re Corporal Punishment By Organs of State.3\n\n[6] Whether, as a matter of strict law, the Magistrate was correct in deferring the execution of\n\nthe whipping4, is not in issue.  He deserves to be commended for treating as a matter of\n\n     3 1991(3) SA 76 (NmSC).\n\n     4 In S v Pretorius 1987(2) SA 250 (NC) it was held that where a magistrate has, in terms of section 294 of the\nAct, sentenced a juvenile offender to a whipping, and has conjoined a sentence which is subject to automatic review\n\n\f3\n\npriority an issue involving fundamental human rights and in particular, the application of\n\nthe provisions of Chapter 3 of the Constitution.  He indeed went further than merely taking\n\nthe initiative to submit the matter for special review.\n\n[7]\n\nA  sentence  of  juvenile  whipping  in  terms  of  section  294  of  the  Act  is  not  normally\n\nreviewable; the whipping is therefore administered immediately after sentence is passed.\n\nThere must have been countless instances in the past where courts sitting on appeal or\n\nreview have had to set aside sentences imposed by trial courts because of irregularities;\n\nwhere those offenders had been sentenced to a juvenile whipping, the punishment would\n\nalmost invariably have been carried out already.5  Once a whipping has been administered,\n\nas is the case with five of the applicants in this matter, any decision which this Court\n\ncomes  to,  will  make  no  practical  difference  to  them  for  purposes  of  the  present\n\nproceedings.  Mindful of this, Mr Dippenaar ordered that the sentence of five strokes\n\nimposed  by  him  on  the  applicant  Williams  should  not  be  carried  out  until  the  issue,\n\nwhether or not the punishment was consistent with the Constitution, had been finally\n\ndecided by the appropriate court.  The concern he displayed is to be welcomed.\n\n[8]\n\nCourts do have a role to play in the promotion and development of a new culture \"founded\n\non the recognition of human rights,\"6 in particular, with regard to those rights which are\n\nenshrined in the Constitution.  It is a role which demands that a court should be particularly\n\nsensitive to the impact which the exercise of judicial functions may have on the rights of\n\nindividuals who appear before them; vigilance is an integral component of this role, for\n\nit is incumbent on structures set up to administer justice to ensure that as far as possible,\n\nthese rights, particularly of the weakest and the most vulnerable, are defended and not\n\nignored.  One of the implications of the new order is that old rules and practices can no\n\nlonger be taken for granted; they must be subjected to constant re-assessment to bring them\n\nto the whipping, the magistrate does not have the jurisdiction to suspend the infliction of the whipping pending the\nresult of the review.  The case might of course be distinguishable on the basis that what is at issue here and what\nis sought to be reviewed, is the sentence of whipping.\n\n     5 See S v Ruiters en Andere, S v Beyers en Andere, S v Louw en 'n Ander 1975(3) SA 526 (C); S v M 1982(1)\nSA 240 (N); S v V en 'n Ander 1989(1) SA 532 (A); S v F 1989(1) SA 460 (ZHC); S v Zuzani and Others\n1991(1) SACR 534 (Tk).\n\n     6 See the provision in the Constitution under the heading \u201cNational Unity and Reconciliation.\u201d \n\n\finto line with the provisions of the Constitution.\n\n4\n\n[9]\n\nIt was no doubt because of these considerations that Conradie J advised magistrates for\n\ntheir  guidance  that,  pending  the  decision  of  this  Court,  it  would  be  undesirable  for\n\nsentences of whipping, in terms of section 294 of the Act, to be imposed and that where\n\nsuch sentence had in fact been imposed, it might not be appropriate for it to be carried out\n\nuntil a ruling from the Constitutional Court had been obtained.\n\n[10] When  the  matter  was  argued  before  this  Court,  it  was  common  cause  between  the\n\napplicants and the State that the provisions in our law which authorise corporal punishment\n\nfor adults are inconsistent with the Constitution. This consensus of course does not remove\n\nthose provisions from the statute book; they have not been set aside by a competent body\n\nor authority and the relevant legislation has not been repealed.  The agreement is, however,\n\nan acknowledgement of the effect which the provisions of the Constitution have in forcing\n\na re-assessment of the laws that govern us against the values expressed in the Constitution.\n\nThe effect is to demarcate the parameters of civilised behaviour, at least at the level of the\n\nadministration of justice. \n\n[11] Apart from provisions which permit juvenile whipping, the law presently allows whipping\n\nas a punishment which may be imposed upon adult males between the ages of 21 and 30\n\nyears.  This is notwithstanding the fact that over the last thirty years at least, South African\n\njurisprudence has been experiencing a growing unanimity in judicial condemnation of\n\ncorporal punishment for adults. Criticism of the practice has been consistent and emphatic,\n\nit being characterised as \"punishment of a particularly severe kind ... brutal in its nature\n\n... a severe assault upon not only the person of the recipient but upon his dignity as a human\n\nbeing\";7 \"a very severe and humiliating form of punishment\";8 \"`n uiterste strafvorm\";9 \"`n\n\nerg  vernederende  en  fisies  baie  pynlike  vorm  van  bestraffing\";10  \"cruel  and  inhuman\n\n     7  Fannin J in S v Kumalo and Others 1965(4) SA 565 (N) at 574F; see also S v Maisa 1968(1) SA 271 (T)\nat 271E.\n\n     8 De Wet CJ in S v Myute and Others and S v Baby 1985(2) SA 61 (Ck) at 62H; see also S v Zimo en Andere\n1971(3) SA 337 (T) at 338G; S v Ruiters et al supra note 5, at 530B; S v Seeland 1982(4) SA 472 (NC) at 476H.\n\n     9 Conradie J in S v Staggie 1990(1) SACR 669 (C) at 675C.\n\n     10 MT Steyn in S v V en 'n Ander supra note 5, at 543D.\n\n\fpunishment.\u201d11  This tone of condemnation is to be found, not only in many decisions in this\n\n5\n\ncountry,12 but also in other jurisdictions.13\n\n \n\n[12]\n\nIf adult whipping were to be abolished, it would simply be an endorsement by our criminal\n\njustice system of a world-wide trend to move away from whipping as a punishment.  As\n\nfar back as 1947, the Lansdown Commission of Enquiry, while recommending the retention\n\nof corporal punishment in limited form in South Africa, made the point that most civilized\n\ncountries in the world had abandoned corporal punishment as a method of dealing with\n\ncrime.  The report of the Viljoen Commission, tabled in Parliament in January 1977, also\n\nendorsed the view that whipping for adults was a brutal assault, not only on the person of\n\nthe recipient, but also on his dignity as a human being.\n\n[13]\n\nThe provisions being challenged, however, relate to juvenile whipping.  The State was at\n\npains to point out that there are differences between adult and juvenile whipping.  The\n\ncontention was that corporal punishment was not in itself objectionable, particularly when\n\nrestricted to male youths; what rendered adult whipping constitutionally unacceptable was\n\nthe manner in which it was executed.  The nub of the enquiry is, however, not the legality\n\nor otherwise of adult whipping or how different it is from juvenile whipping.  The issue\n\nis  whether  juvenile  whipping,  on  its  own  merits  or  demerits,  is  consistent  with  the\n\nConstitution. \n\n   \n\n[14]\n\nThe Act contains a number of related provisions which deal with the infliction of corporal\n\npunishment.14  In so far as juveniles are concerned, no minimum age is fixed in the Act\n\nalthough practice and judicial decisions would seem to have fixed the lower age limit at\n\n     11 Greenland J in S v F supra note 5, at 460I.\n\n     12  See S v Ximba and 2 Others 1972(1) PH H66 (N); S v Motsoesoana 1986(3) SA 350 (N) at 355D; S v\nDaniels 1991(2) SACR 403 (C) at 406B.\n\n     13 See e.g., S v Ncube; S v Tshuma; S v Ndlovu 1988(2) SA 702 (ZSC); Ex Parte Attorney-General, Namibia:\nin re Corporal Punishment supra note 3.\n\n     14  Some sections contain general provisions which are applicable to both adults and juveniles, e.g. section 276\nwhich lists whipping as one of a range of punishments which may be imposed and section 292 which provides\ngeneral guidelines for whipping. \n\n\f6\n\n9 years.15  A whipping may not be imposed \"if it is proved that the existence of some\n\npsychoneurotic or psychopathic condition contributed towards the commission of the\n\noffence.\"16  Section 294(1)(a) provides for whipping to be carried out \"by such person and\n\nin such place and with such instrument as the court may determine.\" We were informed\n\nthat, in practice, a cane is used, but it is significant that the Act leaves this to the discretion\n\nof the magistrate.17  The maximum number of strokes that may be imposed at any one time\n\nis seven.18  Juvenile whipping is inflicted over the buttocks, which must be covered with\n\nnormal attire 19  and a parent or guardian may be present.20  No whipping may be carried\n\nout unless a district surgeon or an assistant district surgeon has certified that the juvenile\n\n\"is in a fit state of health to undergo the whipping.\"21   Juveniles over the age of 17 years\n\nmay be sentenced to a whipping in addition to any other sentence, provided that where a\n\nsentence of imprisonment is imposed, the whole period must be suspended.22 \n\n[15]\n\nThe applicants sought to impugn section 294 of the Act on a number of grounds.  It was\n\ncontended that this provision violated sections 8, 10, 11, and 30 of the Constitution.  These\n\nprovisions are contained in Chapter 3, which is generally referred to as the Chapter on\n\nFundamental Rights.\n\n[16]\n\nSection 8(1) of the Constitution guarantees to each person \"the right to equality and to\n\n     15 See S v Du Preez 1975(4) SA 606 (C). \n\n     16 Section 295(2).\n\n     17 Section 292(2) of the Act prescribes a cane as the instrument to be used for adult whiping.  See also section\n92(1)(c) of the Magistrates\u2019 Court Act No. 32 of 1944 (as amended) which prescribes that a cane only may be\nused for whipping.  This provision, however, excludes juvenile whipping in terms of section 294.  During oral\nargument, we were informed that, in practice, canes conforming to the dimensions listed in the regulations of the\nDepartment of Correctional Services are used for both adult and juvenile whipping.  See Regulation 100(4)\npromulgated in terms of section 94 of the Correctional Services Act No. 8 of 1959 (as amended) which provides\nthat canes used for the whipping of prisoners should approximate 125cm in length and 12 mm in width for adults\nand 100cm by 9mm for juveniles.  \n\n     18 Section 294(1)(a).\n\n     19 Section 294(2).\n\n     20 Section 294(3).\n\n     21 Section 294(5).\n\n     22 Section 294(1)(b).\n\n\f7\n\nequal protection of the law.\"  Section 8(2) prohibits unfair discrimination on grounds\n\nwhich include race, gender, sex, colour, and age; according to section 8(4), \"[p]rima facie\n\nproof of discrimination on any of the grounds specified  ...  shall be presumed to be\n\nsufficient proof of unfair discrimination  ...  until the contrary is established.\"  Applicants\n\nargued that the provisions of section 294 of the Act discriminated unfairly against male\n\njuveniles on grounds of age and sex and, in the context of South Africa's unjust and unequal\n\npast, their application was susceptible to racial bias.\n\n[17]\n\nSection 10, for its part, guarantees to every person \" the right to respect for and protection\n\nof his or her dignity.\"  The proposition advanced was that the circumstances under which\n\njuvenile  whipping  is  administered,  including  the  fact  that  it  involves  the  intentional\n\ninfliction of physical pain on the juvenile by a stranger at the instance of the State, are\n\nincompatible  with  respect  for  and  the  protection  of  the  dignity  of  the  person  being\n\npunished.  It was contended that this was a violation of the dignity of both the minor as\n\nwell as that of the person administering the whipping.\n\n[18]\n\nThe provisions of section 30 of the Constitution are designed to protect children.  It was\n\nargued that inasmuch as the Constitution recognises the vulnerability of children as a group\n\nand sets out to protect them, juvenile whipping infringed their right to security and not to\n\nbe subjected to abuse.\n\n[19] Much of applicants' argument was, understandably enough, devoted to the alleged violation\n\nof section 11(2) of the Constitution.  As the heading indicates, this section deals with\n\n\"[f]reedom and security of the person\" and the subsection provides that \"[n]o person\n\nshall be subject to torture of any kind, whether physical, mental or emotional, nor shall any\n\nperson be subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\"  This is the only\n\nprovision, among those relied upon by the applicants, that expressly refers to punishment.\n\n I propose to deal with the impact, if any, of sections 10 and 11(2) of the Constitution on\n\nthe conduct which is prescribed by section 294 of the Act.\n\n[20]\n\nIt is clear that when the words of section 11(2) of the Constitution are read disjunctively,\n\n\f8\n\nas they should be,23  the provision refers to seven distinct modes of conduct, namely:\n\ntorture; cruel treatment; inhuman treatment; degrading treatment; cruel punishment; inhuman\n\npunishment and degrading punishment.\n\n[21]\n\nIn common with many of the rights entrenched in the Constitution, the wording of this\n\nsection conforms to a large extent with most international human rights instruments.24\n\nGenerally,  the  right  is  guaranteed  in  absolute,  non-derogable  and  unqualified  terms;\n\njustification in those instances is not possible.25\n\n[22]\n\nThe interpretation of the concepts contained in section 11(2) of the Constitution involves\n\nthe  making  of  a  value  judgment  which  \u201crequires  objectively  to  be  articulated  and\n\nidentified, regard being had to the contemporary norms, aspirations, expectations and\n\nsensitivities of the ... people as expressed in its national institutions and its Constitution,\n\nand further having regard to the emerging consensus of values in the civilised international\n\ncommunity ... \u201d26 \n\n[23] While  our  ultimate  definition  of  these  concepts  must  necessarily  reflect  our  own\n\nexperience and contemporary circumstances as the South African community, there is no\n\ndisputing that valuable insights may be gained from the manner in which the concepts are\n\ndealt with in public international law as well as in foreign case law.\n\n     23  See S v Ncube, S v Tshuma, S v Ndhlovu supra note 13, at 714I-715D and Ex Parte Attorney General,\nNamibia: In re Corporal Punishment supra note 3, at 86A-C. \n\n     24 Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the General Assembly of the United\nNations on 10 December 1948, forbids \"torture or . . . cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\nAccording to Sieghart, The International Law of Human Rights (1983) 159-160 and 162, the wording has been\nfollowed with minor variations in a number of other international instruments and national constitutions adopted\nsince 1949. See e.g., Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which is\nidentical; Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n( \"torture or . . . inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\"); Article 5 of the Banjul Charter on Human and\nPeoples' Rights (African Charter) (\". . . torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and treatment\"). \n\n     25  Article 8 of the Namibian Constitution, for instance, provides: \u201c(1) The dignity of all persons shall be\ninviolable. (2)(a) . . . (b) No persons shall be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or\npunishment.\"  No limitation applies to this provision.  See also Ex Parte Attorney General, Namibia supra note\n3, at 86D; Sieghart op cit at 161.\n\n     26 Mahomed AJA in Ex Parte Attorney-General, Namibia supra, note 3, at 86 I. \n\n\f9\n\n[24]\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines 'cruel' as \"causing or inflicting pain without pity,\"\n\n'inhuman' as \"destitute of natural kindness or pity, brutal, unfeeling, savage, barbarous\" and\n\n'degrading' as \"lowering in character or quality, moral or intellectual debasement.\"  In\n\nSouth African case law, definitions of \u2018cruel,\u2019 with regard to treatment or punishment are\n\nrare.  The phrase \"cruel treatment\"  has been used in the context of abuse of animals and\n\nhas been described variously as \"wilfully caus[ing] pain without justification ... intention\n\nof causing it unnecessary suffering;\"27  \"deliberate act causing substantial pain and not\n\nreasonably necessary in all the circumstances.\"28\n\n[25] Whether  it  is  necessary  to  split  the  words  of  the  phrase  and  interpret  the  concepts\n\nindividually is a matter which would largely depend on the nature of the conduct sought\n\nto be impugned.   It may well be that in a given case, conduct that is degrading may not be\n\ninhuman or cruel.  On the other hand, other conduct may be all three. It was suggested to\n\nus that a useful approach might be to grade the concepts on a sliding scale of suffering\n\ninflicted,  torture  occupying  the  extreme  position,  followed  by  cruel,  inhuman  and\n\ndegrading, in that order.\n\n[26]\n\nInternational forums offer very little guidance with regard to the meaning to be given to\n\neach word, individually.   The tendency has been to deal with them as phrases or a\n\ncombination of words. Thus when the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC)\n\nwas called upon to interpret the corresponding section in the International Covenant on\n\nCivil and Political Rights (ICCPR), it did not consider \u201cit necessary to draw up a list of\n\nprohibited acts or to establish sharp distinctions between the different kinds of punishment\n\nor treatment; the distinctions depend on the nature, purpose and severity of the treatment\n\napplied.\u201d 29  According to the UNHRC, the assessment of what constitutes inhuman or\n\ndegrading treatment depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration and\n\nmanner of the treatment, its physical or mental effects as well as the sex, age and state of\n\n     27 R v Mountain 1928 TPD 86 at 88.\n\n     28 Hellberg v R 1933 NPD 507 at 510.\n\n     29 General Comment 20.4 of the Human Rights Committee 1992 Report (referred to in and filed with\napplicants\u2019 brief).\n\n\fhealth of the victim. 30\n\n  \n\n10\n\n[27] Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental\n\nFreedoms (European Convention), has been interpreted by distinguishing the concepts\n\nprimarily by the degree of suffering inflicted.31  The European Commission of Human\n\nRights (European Commission) described inhuman treatment as that which \"causes severe\n\nsuffering, mental or physical, which in the particular situation is unjustifiable\" and torture\n\nas \"an aggravated form of inhuman treatment.\u201d  32  The European Court of Human Rights\n\n(European Court) found the difference between torture and inhuman treatment in the fact\n\nthat the former attaches \u201ca special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very\n\nserious and cruel suffering.\"33  The Court also categorised degrading conduct as that which\n\naroused in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority leading to humiliation and\n\ndebasement and possible breaking of their physical or moral resistance.34  The same Court\n\ndistinguished between  inhuman and degrading punishment in Tyrer v United Kingdom,35\n\nand  held  that  suffering  had  to  reach  a  certain  level  before  punishment  could  be\n\ncharacterised as inhuman.  In a case where a juvenile had been sentenced to three strokes\n\nof the birch, the Court found that although that level had not been reached, the birching of\n\nthe minor nevertheless amounted to degrading punishment. \n\n[28]\n\nThe  Eighth  Amendment  to  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States  of  America  (Eighth\n\nAmendment) as well as Article 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n\n(Canadian Charter) prohibit \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" In  Furman v Georgia,36\n\nBrennan J postulated criteria in the assessment of what amounts to cruel and unusual\n\n     30 See Vuolanne v Finland 96 ILR 649, 657.\n\n     31  See P van Dijk and GJH van Hoof, Theory and Practice of the European Convention on Human Rights,\n(1990), 2 ed., 226-227. \n\n     32 See Denmark et al v Greece: Report of 5 November 1969,Yearbook of the European Convention on Human\nRights XII (1969), 186.\n\n     33 The Republic of Ireland v The United Kingdom (1979-80) 2 EHRR 25, 80, paragraph 167.\n\n     34 Id.\n\n     35 (1979-80) 2 EHRR 1, 9, paragraph 29.\n\n     36 408 US 238 (1972). This case held that capital punishment in the then existing statute, providing for capital\npunishment, in the State of Georgia was unconstitutional. \n\n\f11\n\npunishment.  He pointed out that punishment does not become \"cruel and unusual\" merely\n\nbecause of the pain inflicted.  The true significance lay in the fact that members of the\n\nhuman race are treated:\n\n\"... as nonhumans, as objects to be toyed with and discarded ...\n[and that this is] ... thus inconsistent with the fundamental premise\nof the Clause that even the vilest criminal remains a human being\npossessed of common human dignity.\"37\n\n[29] Although  some  of  the  views  expressed  in  Furman v Georgia  were  qualified  in  the\n\nsubsequent case of Gregg v Georgia,38 Stewart J in the latter case affirmed that the basic\n\nconcept underlying the Eighth Amendment \"is the dignity of man.\"39\n\n[30]\n\nThe framework of Canadian rights legislation is not much different from ours and section\n\n1 of the Canadian Charter plays a role not very dissimilar to that of section 33(1) of the\n\nConstitution. The Canadian Supreme Court has interpreted the concept \"cruel and unusual\n\npunishment\" as a \"compendious expression of a norm\" to which the relevant test was\n\n\"whether  the  punishment  prescribed  is  so  excessive  as  to  outrage  the  standards  of\n\ndecency.\"40   Factors to be taken into account in the assessment of the punishment included\n\nits effect, which must not be grossly disproportionate, the gravity of the offence, the\n\npersonal characteristics of the offender and the particular circumstances of the case.\n\nAccording to Dickson CJ and Lamer J:\n\n\"  ...  some  punishments  or  treatments  will  always  be  grossly\ndisproportionate  and  will  always  outrage  our  standards  of\ndecency: for example, the infliction of corporal punishment, such\nas the lash, irrespective of the number of lashes imposed ... \"41\n\n[31]\n\nThe  decisions  of  the  Supreme  Courts  of  Namibia  and  of  Zimbabwe  are  of  special\n\n     37 Id. at 273.\n\n     38  408 US 153 (1976).

Not only are these countries geographic neighbours, but South Africa shares\n\nwith them the same English colonial experience which has had a deep influence on our\n\nlaw; we of course also share the Roman-Dutch legal tradition.  Unlike our Constitution, the\n\nNamibian Constitution does not have a general limitation clause.  Article 22 however\n\nspecifies how limitations, whether they are built-in or are imposed by other laws, are to\n\nbe employed.  In Ex Parte Attorney-General, Namibia, Mahomed AJA had no difficulty\n\nin arriving at the conclusion that the infliction of corporal punishment, whether on adults\n\nor juveniles, was inconsistent with article 8 of the Namibian Constitution and constituted\n\n\"inhuman or degrading\" punishment.42\n\n[32]\n\nIn S v Ncube; S v Tshuma and S v Ndhlovu the Zimbabwe Supreme Court, dealing with\n\nthe  issue  of  corporal  punishment  for  adults,  held  that  the  practice  was  inhuman  and\n\ndegrading in violation of section 15(1) of the Declaration of Rights of the Zimbabwe\n\nConstitution which prohibits \"torture or inhuman or degrading punishment.\"43  The same\n\nconclusion was reached with respect to juvenile whipping by the Zimbabwe High Court\n\nin S v F.44  Juvenile whipping was held to constitute inhuman and degrading punishment\n\nby the Zimbabwe Supreme Court in  S v Juvenile.45  Gubbay JA characterised juvenile\n\nwhipping as:\n\n\" . . . inherently brutal and cruel; for its infliction is attended by\nacute physical pain.   After all, that is precisely what it is designed\nto achieve ...  In short, whipping, which invades the integrity of the\nhuman  body,  is  an  antiquated  and  inhuman  punishment  which\nblocks the way to understanding the pathology of crime.\"46  \n\n[33]\n\nThe Court in Tyrer v United Kingdom characterised the whipping of a juvenile thus:\n\n \n\n\"The very nature of judicial corporal punishment is that it involves\none human being inflicting physical violence on another human\n\n     42 Supra note 3.\n\n     43 Supra note 13, at 721H.\n\n     44 Supra note 5.  At 462I-J Greenland J agreed with the characterisation of corporal punishment as \"barbaric,\ninherently brutal, cruel, inhuman and degrading.\"\n\n     45 1990(4) SA 151 (ZSC).\n\n     46 Id. at 168I-169B.\n\n\f13\n\nbeing. Furthermore, it is institutionalised violence, that is in the\npresent case violence permitted by the law, ordered by the judicial\nauthorities of the State and carried out by the police authorities of\nthe State.  Thus, although the applicant did not suffer any severe or\nlong-lasting physical effects, his punishment - whereby he was\ntreated as an object in the power of the authorities - constituted an\nassault on precisely that which is the main purpose of Article 3 to\nprotect, namely a person's dignity and physical integrity ... The\ninstitutionalised character of this violence is further compounded\nby the whole aura of official procedure attending the punishment\nand by the fact that those inflicting it were total strangers to the\noffender.\"47\n\n[34]\n\nThe circumstances described above are present in any judicial corporal punishment;48 they\n\nare certainly present in juvenile whipping in terms of section 294 of the Act.  They are\n\nconsistent with Mahomed AJA's summary, in Ex Parte Attorney-General, Namibia,49 and\n\nthat of Gubbay JA in S v Ncube, S v Tshuma, S v Ndhlovu50 on the basis of the objection\n\nto corporal punishment.\n\n[35] Whether one speaks of \"cruel and unusual punishment\" as in the Eighth Amendment of the\n\nUnited States Constitution and in article 12 of the Canadian Charter, or \"inhuman or\n\ndegrading punishment\" as in the European Covention and the Constitution of Zimbabwe,\n\nor \"cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment\" as in the Universal Declaration of Human\n\nRights,  the ICCPR and the Constitution of Namibia, the common thread running through\n\nthe assessment of each phrase is the identification and acknowledgement of society's\n\nconcept of decency and human dignity.\n\n \n\n[36]\n\nIn the United States, the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution is interpreted in the light of\n\n\"contemporary standards of decency.\"  These standards, it has been held, are not static but\n\nare continually evolving.51  The relationship between \"contemporary standards of decency\"\n\n     47 Supra note 35, at 11, paragraph 33.\n\n     48 See S v Juvenile supra note 45, at 156F-H.\n\n     49 Supra note 3, at 87D-H.\n\n     50 Supra note 13, at 722A-D.\n\n     51  In Trop v Dulles 356 US 86 (1958) at page 101, it was held that the Eighth Amendment must draw its\nmeaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.  In Weems v United\n\n\f14\n\nand public opinion is uncertain and I am not convinced that they are synonymous.   It is\n\nclear, as was pointed out by Chaskalson P in State v Makwanyane and Mchunu that public\n\nopinion, on its own, is not determinative of constitutional issues:\n\n\"If public opinion were to be decisive there would be no need for\nconstitutional adjudication. The protection of rights could then be\nleft to Parliament, which has a mandate from the public . . . but this\nwould be a return to parliamentary sovereignty, and a retreat from\nthe new legal order established by the 1993 Constitution.\"52 \n\n[37]\n\nIt  is  not  clear  to  me  however  that  it  is  necessary  to  adopt  the  American  concept  of\n\n\"contemporary standards of decency\" or that it is necessary to give definitive meaning to\n\nthat phrase.   Our Constitution is different to the American constitution.  Section 35(1) of\n\nthe Constitution provides expressly that the rights entrenched in it, including sections 10\n\nand 11(2), shall be interpreted in accordance with the values which underlie an open and\n\ndemocratic society based on freedom and equality.  In determining whether punishment is\n\ncruel, inhuman or degrading within the meaning of our Constitution, the punishment in\n\nquestion must be assessed in the light of the values which underlie the Constitution.\n\n[38]\n\nThe simple message is that the State must, in imposing punishment, do so in accordance\n\nwith certain standards; these will reflect the values which underpin the Constitution; in the\n\npresent context, it means that punishment must respect human dignity and be consistent with\n\nthe provisions of the Constitution.\n\n[39]\n\nThere is unmistakably a growing consensus in the international community that judicial\n\nwhipping, involving as it does the deliberate infliction of physical pain on the person of\n\nthe accused, offends society's notions of decency and is a direct invasion of the right which\n\nevery person has to human dignity.   This consensus has found expression through the\n\ncourts and legislatures of various countries and through international instruments.  It is a\n\nStates 217 US 349 (1910) at page 378, the court observed that the Eighth Amendment is progressive and does not\nmerely prohibit cruel punishments known in 1688 and 1787, but may acquire wider meaning \u201cas public opinion\nbecomes enlightened by humane justice.\u201d  In Jackson v Bishop 404 F 2d 571 (1968) at page 579, reference is\nmade to \"contemporary concepts of decency and human dignity and precepts of civilisation which we profess to\npossess\";  see also Nelson v Heyne 491 F 2d 352 (1974). \n\n     52 Case No. CCT/ 3/94 at paragraph 88. \n\n\fclear trend which has been established.\n\n15\n\n[40] Corporal punishment has been abolished in a wide range of countries, including: the United\n\nKingdom,53  Australia (except in the State of Western Australia),54 the United States of\n\nAmerica,    55  Canada,    56  Europe      57  and  Mozambique,58  among  others.  In  Lesotho,\n\nrestrictions have been imposed by the courts on the whipping of people over 30 years.59\n\nAlthough the Constitution of Botswana contains a provision preserving the application of\n\njudicial corporal punishment in its criminal justice system, the practice has been severely\n\ncriticised by the judiciary. The remarks of Aguda, JA in  S v Petrus and Another are\n\napposite to the present enquiry:\n\n\"First, it must be recognised that certain types of punishment or\ntreatment are by their very nature cruel, inhuman or degrading.\nHere  once  more  I  must  cite  with  approval  what  Professor\nNwabueze  says  in  his  book  (ibid):  'Any  punishment  involving\ntorture,  such  as  the  rack,  the  thumbscrew,  the  iron  boot,  the\nstretching  of  limbs,  burning  alive  or  at  the  stake,  crucifixion,\nbreaking  on  the  wheel,  embowelling  alive,  beheading,  public\n\n      53 This was done by the introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 1948, pursuant to the Report of the\nDepartmental Committee on Corporal Punishment(1938) (the Cadogan Committee).

Only the State of Delaware still retains the\n\u2018whipping post.\u2019 Ncube supra note 13 at 713B-C.\n\n     56 Canada abolished corporal punishment through the enactment of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1972.\nNcube supra note 13 at 710H.\n\n     57  In the applicants\u2019 written argument it was pointed out that the Tyrer case effectively proscribed judicial\ncorporal punishment in countries subject to the European Convention; the Netherlands Government has declared\nthat corporal punishment is a violation of international instruments; Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and\nAustria have formally proscribed corporal punishment in institutions as well as in the home; and Cyprus abolished\nall corporal punishment in 1994.\n\n     58  Public floggings were abolished in 1989 in accordance with the country's obligations under the African\nCharter  on  Human  and  People's  Rights.

Secondly,  a  punishment  which  is  not\ninherently inhuman or degrading may become so by the very nature\nor mode of execution, and also notwithstanding the fact that popular\ndemand may favour it.\"60\n\n[41] Great play was made by the State of  differences between adult and juvenile whipping.\n\nThe point of the argument was that while it may be difficult to justify the whipping of adults\n\nin constitutional terms, juvenile whipping was no more reprehensible than other forms of\n\npunishment, since an element of humiliation and degradation is to be found in most.  I did\n\nnot understand the State to be seriously contending that any punishment which involves an\n\nelement  of  humiliation  or  degradation  constituted  a  breach  of  section  11(2)  of  the\n\nConstitution. The argument was rather that judicial whipping was not an infringement of\n\nany of the rights of the juvenile.\n\n[42]\n\nIn  Tyrer  v  United  Kingdom  the  European  Court  put  its  finger  on  the  basis  for  the\n\ndistinction between punishment per se and punishment which was prohibited in terms of\n\narticle 3 of the European Convention: the humiliation or debasement involved must attain\n\na particular level and must be other than the usual, and perhaps inevitable, element of\n\nhumiliation associated with punishment in general.61  In  Furman v Georgia Brennan J\n\nmade  it  quite  clear  what  he  found  to  be  particularly  objectionable  in  this  species  of\n\npunishment:\n\n\"...since  the  discontinuance  of  flogging  as  a  constitutionally\npermissible punishment, Jackson v Bishop 404 F2d 571 (CA8)\n1968, death remains as the only punishment that may involve the\nconscious infliction of physical pain.\"62\n\n[43]\n\nThe fact that there may be other punishments which violate fundamental rights cannot, in\n\n     60 [1985] LRC (Const) 699, 725G-726A.\n\n     61 Supra note 35, at 10, paragraph 30. \n\n     62 Supra note 36, at 287-288.\n\n\fitself, save the specific form of punishment that has been challenged from invalidity.\n\n17\n\n[44] Differences between adult and juvenile whipping have, in my view, little or no relevance\n\nto the enquiry.  They are in any event differences of degree rather than kind.   To the extent\n\nthat comment is needed on the argument which has been raised, however, I am of the view\n\nthat the differences are far outweighed by the similarities. There is a small difference in\n\nthe dimensions of the instrument used;63 the adult is stripped naked and trussed, the strokes\n\nbeing delivered on bare flesh while the juvenile's strokes are inflicted on normal attire,\n\nwithout him being tied; there is no limit to the number of times a juvenile may be sentenced\n\nto receive strokes while the adult may only be so sentenced twice, and never within a\n\nperiod of three years of the previous sentence of strokes.  Both occur in a state institution;\n\nthe maximum number of strokes that may be imposed is seven in respect of both.  Both\n\ninvolve a physical beating with a cane wielded by a State  employee, a virtual stranger to\n\nthe person being punished.\n\n[45]\n\nThe severity of the pain inflicted is arbitrary, depending as it does almost entirely on the\n\nperson administering the whipping.  Although the juvenile is not trussed, he is as helpless.\n\n He has to submit to the beating, his terror and sensitivity to pain notwithstanding.  Nor is\n\nthere any solace to be derived from the fact that there is a prior examination by the district\n\nsurgeon.  The fact that the adult is stripped naked merely accentuates the degradation and\n\nhumiliation.  The whipping of both is, in itself, a severe affront to their dignity as human\n\nbeings.   I agree with the dicta in Campbell and Cosans v United Kingdom in which Mr\n\nKlecker, in a dissenting opinion, stated:\n\n \n\n\"Corporal punishment amounts to a total lack of respect for the\nhuman being; it therefore cannot depend on the age of the human\nbeing  ...  The  sum  total  of  adverse  effects,  whether  actual  or\npotential,  produced  by  corporal  punishment  on  the  mental  and\nmoral development of a child is enough, as I see it, to describe it\nas degrading within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention.\"64\n\n     63 Supra note 17.\n\n     64 (1980) 3 EHRR 531 at 556.\n\n\f18\n\n[46]\n\nIt was further claimed that age in itself  was a redeeming feature;  that while an adult\n\nwhose character and personality has already been formed was likely to be hardened by\n\nthe infliction of judicial whipping, the position was the opposite in the case of a juvenile.\n\nThe basis for this was the view that as a juvenile's character was still in the process of\n\nformation, he was  still susceptible to correction and advice; corporal punishment might\n\ntherefore still have a reformative effect on the young even though it was accepted that it\n\nwas likely to have the opposite effect on the old.   \n\n[47]\n\nI do not agree.  One would have thought that it is precisely because a juvenile is of a more\n\nimpressionable and sensitive nature that he should be protected from experiences which\n\nmay cause him to be coarsened and hardened.  If the State, as role model par excellence,\n\ntreats the weakest and the most vulnerable among us in a manner which diminishes rather\n\nthan enhances their self-esteem and human dignity, the danger increases that  their regard\n\nfor a culture of decency and respect for the rights of others will be diminished.  As\n\nBrandeis J observes in a dissenting opinion in Olmstead v United States:\n\n\"Our Government is the potent, the omni-present teacher.  For good\nor for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.\"65  \n\n[48]\n\nThe issue of corporal punishment at schools is by no means free of controversy.  The\n\npractice  has  inevitably  come  in  for  strong  criticism. 66  In  Costello-Roberts v United\n\nKingdom,67  the European Court applied the criteria set in Tyrer v United Kingdom that,\n\nin order for punishment to be \"degrading\" and in breach of article 3 of the Convention, the\n\nhumiliation or debasement involved must attain a particular level of severity and must, in\n\nany event, be other than the usual element of humiliation inherent in any punishment.  It\n\ndrew a distinction between a judicially imposed whipping,  as in Tyrer v United Kingdom,\n\n     65 277 US 438 (1928) at 485.\n\n     66  See the remarks of Dumbutshena CJ in S v A Juvenile supra note 45, at 161E-162E.  See also Campbell\nand Cosans v United Kingdom supra note 64, at 556. \n\n     67 Judgment delivered on 25 March 1993.  Appellants referred to and included in their brief a Press Release\nissued on 25 March 1993 by the Registrar of the European Court of Human Rights which contained a synopsis of\nthe judgment delivered that day.   See also the discussion in Barry Phillips, The Case for Corporal Punishment\nin the United Kingdom. Beaten into Submission in Europe, 43 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n(1994) 153. \n\n\f19\n\nand punishment meted out on a juvenile boarder through disciplinary rules in force in a\n\nprivate school.  This amounted to being slippered three times on his buttocks through his\n\nshorts with a rubber-soled gym shoe by the headmaster in private.   The court held that in\n\nthe circumstances of the particular case, the minimum level of severity had not been\n\nattained.  It is noteworthy that the decision was carried by the narrowest of margins, with\n\nfive judges voting for it and four against.  What is of interest is how the Euorpean Court,\n\nin the exercise of a value judgment, went about evaluating the impugned conduct and\n\ndistinguishing between the concepts \u2018inhuman\u2019 and \u2018degrading.\u201968  \n\n[49]\n\nIt is not necessary to comment on the suggestion that judicial corporal punishment is in\n\nreality no worse than cuts imposed at school; the subject of corporal punishment in schools\n\nis not before us. Suffice it to point out that the European Court in Costello-Roberts v The\n\nUnited Kingdom69 seemed to attach some importance to the difference between strokes\n\ninflicted by a policeman as a result of a court order, on the one hand, and corporal\n\npunishment administered by a headmaster in terms of disciplinary rules in force within the\n\nschool in which the youth was a boarder. On the other hand, it was White J in a dissenting\n\nopinion in Ingraham v Wright who stated:\n\n\"Where  corporal  punishment  becomes  so  severe  as  to  be\nunacceptable in a civilised society, I can see no reason that it\nshould become any more acceptable just because it is inflicted on\nchildren in the public schools.\"70\n\n[50]\n\nThe Constitution requires us to \"have regard\" to the consensus referred to above;71 we are\n\nnot bound to follow it but neither can we ignore it.  The determinative test will be the\n\nvalues we find inherent in or worthy of pursuing in this society which has only recently\n\nembarked on the road to democracy.  Already South Africa has lagged behind.  The\n\nConstitution now offers an opportunity for South Africans to join the mainstream of a\n\nworld community that is progressively moving away from punishments that place undue\n\n     68 Press Release supra note 67, paragraphs 30-32.  See also Barry Phillips supra note 67, at 168. \n\n     69 Press release supra note 67, paragraph 31.\n\n     70 430 US 651 at 692.\n\n     71 See section 35(1) of the Constitution.\n\n\f20\n\nemphasis  on  retribution  and  vengeance  rather  than  on  correction,  prevention  and  the\n\nrecognition of human rights.   \n\n[51]\n\nIn interpreting section 11(2) of the Constitution, however, we should not only have regard\n\nto the position in other jurisdictions.  This Court has held that in interpreting the rights\n\nenshrined in Chapter 3 of the Constitution, a purposive approach should be adopted.72  In\n\nseeking the purpose of the particular rights, it is important to place them in the context of\n\nSouth African society.  It is regrettable, but undeniable, that since the middle 1980's our\n\nsociety has been subjected to an unprecedented wave of violence.  Disputes, whether\n\npolitical, industrial or personal, often end in violent assaults.  In addition, during the same\n\nperiod, there has been a marked increase in violent crimes, such as armed robbery and\n\nmurder.  \n\n[52]\n\nThe process of political negotiations which resulted in the Constitution were a rejection\n\nof violence.  In this context, it cannot be doubted that the institutionalised use of violence\n\nby the State on juvenile offenders as authorised by section 294 of the Act is a cruel,\n\ninhuman and degrading punishment.  The Government has a particular responsibility to\n\nsustain  and  promote  the  values  of  the  Constitution.    If  it  is  not  exacting  in  its\n\nacknowledgement of those values, the Constitution will be weakened.   A culture of\n\nauthority which legitimates the use of violence is inconsistent with the values for which\n\nthe Constitution stands. \n\n[53]\n\nThe  conclusion  that  I  have  reached,  that  section  294  of  the  Act  infringes  the  rights\n\ncontained in sections 10 and 11(2) of the Constitution is consistent with the view that has\n\nbeen expressed by many South African judges before.   As already indicated, the courts in\n\nthis country have acknowledged the international consensus against corporal punishment\n\nand, in a sense, associated themselves with it in many judgments which have criticised,\n\nsometimes  in  the  strongest  terms,  the  infliction  of  corporal  punishment.73      Judicial\n\ncondemnation  has  resulted  in  adult  whipping  being  imposed  only  in  exceptional\n\n     72 S v Zuma and Others 1995(4) BCLR 401 (SA) at 410F-412H ;  S v Makwanyane and Mchunu supra note\n52, at paragraphs 9 and 10.\n\n     73 See the cases cited supra notes 7 to 12.\n\n\f21\n\ncircumstances and juvenile whipping, in general, only as a device to keep the juvenile out\n\nof prison.74\n\n[54]\n\nThe structure and content of Chapter 3 suggests a two-stage enquiry.  The first stage is\n\nconcerned with establishing whether there is a violation of a right sought to be protected\n\nby the Constitution;  this has been answered in the affirmative.   The second leg of the\n\nenquiry deals with the question whether the violation constitutes a permissible limitation\n\nof the right in question.   Section 33(1) of the Constitution provides:\n\n\"The rights entrenched in this Chapter may be limited by law of\ngeneral application, provided that such limitation ---\n\n(a) \n\nshall be permissible only to the extent that\nit is  --\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nreasonable; and\njustifiable in an open and democratic society \nbased on freedom and equality; and \n\n(b) \n\n(aa)\n\nshall not negate the essential content of the\nright in question, and provided further that\nany limitation to ---\na right entrenched in section 10, 11 . . . \n\n                          \n\n           \n\nshall,  in  addition  to  being  reasonable  as  required  in\nparagraph (a)(i), also be necessary.\u201d  \n\n[55] Applicants contended firstly, that the rights at issue were not capable of limitation and that\n\nsection 33(1) of the Constitution was therefore not applicable.   The implication of this\n\nproposition was that no further enquiry was called for once a violation of the right had\n\nbeen proved.\n\n[56]\n\nThis argument raises an issue which this Court may have to confront in the future and that\n\nis the tension between threshold requirements and requirements of limitation.   The issue\n\nhas been raised in argument in other cases which have come before us.  It is, however, not\n\nan issue which needs to be resolved in this case.  In S v Makwanyane (supra) this court\n\ndealt with section 11(2) of the Constitution on the basis that section 33(1) is applicable to\n\n     74 See S v Maisa supra note 7, at 271E; S v Machwili 1986 1) SA 156 (N) at 157F-G; S v Motsoesoana supra\nnote 12, at page 358G; S v Zimo en Andere supra note 8, at page 337H-338A; S v Maseti 1992(2) SACR 459 (C)\nat page 464I-J; S v V en \u2018n Ander supra note 5, at page 543E; S v P 1985 (4) SA 105 (N) at page 107F; and S v M\nsupra note 5, at page 245B.\n\n\fbreaches of that section.  I follow the same approach in the present case.\n\n22\n\n[57] Applicants  claimed  further  that  even  if  the  right  was  subject  to  limitation,    juvenile\n\nwhipping provisions failed to satisfy the requirements of section 33(1) of the Constitution.\n\n The attitude of the State was that juvenile whipping was neither cruel nor inhuman and it\n\nwas no more degrading than other acceptable punishments; it was contended that to the\n\nextent that the punishment could be said to be in some way humiliating or degrading, it\n\nwas within permissible constitutional limits because of the provisions of  section 33(1)\n\nof the Constitution.\n\n[58]\n\nThe enquiry involves testing the measures adopted against the objective sought to be\n\nachieved.   The gist of it, put in the context and the language of section 33(1), really\n\namounts initially to three questions, namely:  (a)  whether the means used are reasonable\n\n; (b) whether they are justifiable in the context of the civilized society we hope we are or\n\nwhich we, through this Constitution, are aspiring to be; and (c) whether they are necessary\n\nto attain the objective.  The test relies on proportionality, a process of weighing up the\n\nindividual's right which the State wishes to limit against the objective which the State\n\nseeks to achieve by such limitation.\n\n[59]\n\nThis evaluation must necessarily take place against the backdrop of the values of South\n\nAfrican society as articulated in the Constitution and in other legislation, in the decisions\n\nof our courts and generally against our own experiences as a people.\n\n \n\n[60]\n\nIn State v Makwanyane and Mchunu Chaskalson P deals with the \"proportionality\" test\n\nwhich is also implicit in the limitation of rights in Canada and the European Court.75   As\n\na general conclusion he notes that the limitation of constitutional rights for a purpose that\n\nis necessary in a democratic society involves the weighing up of competing values, and\n\nultimately  an  assessment  based  on  proportionality.    He  points  out  how  the  German\n\nConstitutional Court applies the  proportionality test in dealing with limitations authorised\n\n     75 Supra note 52, at paragraphs 104-109.   \n\n\fby the German Constitution:  \n\n23\n\n\"It has regard to the purpose of the limiting legislation, whether the\nlegislation in fact achieves that purpose, whether it is necessary\ntherefor, and whether a proper balance has been achieved between\nthe value enhanced by the limitation, and the fundamental right that\nhas been limited.\"76 \n\n[61]\n\nThe grounds on which the State sought to justify juvenile whipping were, firstly, that it\n\nmade good practical sense to have juvenile whipping as a sentencing option.  The practice\n\nhad advantages for both the offender and the State, particularly in view of a shortage of\n\nresources and the infrastructure required for the implementation of other sentencing options\n\nfor juveniles.  Secondly, it was suggested that juvenile whipping was a deterrent.\n\n[62]\n\nThe purpose of section 294 of the Act is to provide a sentencing option for the punishment\n\nof juvenile offenders.  What must be addressed is whether it is reasonable, justifiable and\n\nnecessary to resort to juvenile whipping, notwithstanding the fact that it \"constitutes a\n\nsevere assault upon not only the person of the recipient, but upon his dignity as a human\n\nbeing.\"77   The primary argument advanced in favour of juvenile whipping was that it\n\nconstitutes a better alternative to imprisonment, particularly in the so-called \"grey area\"\n\ncrimes.  This was a reference to instances  where a court has to deal with an offence which\n\nis  not  so  serious  as  to  merit  a  custodial  sentence  but  is  serious  enough  to  render\n\ninappropriate the use of  \"softer\" sentences.  \n\n[63]\n\nIt was argued that sentencing alternatives for juveniles were limited and that this country\n\ndid not have a sufficiently well-established physical and human resource base which was\n\ncapable of supporting the imposition of alternative punishments.  This is of course an\n\nargument based on pragmatism rather than principle.  It is a problem which must be taken\n\nseriously nevertheless.  It seems to me, however, to be another way of saying that our\n\nsociety has not yet established mechanisms to deal with juveniles who find themselves in\n\nconflict with the law; that the price to be paid for this state of unreadiness is to subject\n\njuveniles to punishment that is cruel, inhuman or degrading.  The proposition is untenable.\n\n     76 Supra note 52, at paragraph 108.\n\n     77 Fannin J in S v Kumalo supra note 7, at 547F.\n\n\f24\n\nIt is diametrically opposed to the values that fuel our progress towards being a more\n\nhumane and caring society.  It would be a negation of those values precisely where we\n\nshould be laying a strong foundation for them, in the young; the future custodians of this\n\nfledgeling democracy. \n\n[64] We nevertheless need to examine available resources to determine whether there are\n\nindeed appropriate sentencing options.  It has to be borne in mind that the presence of\n\nvarious options in a number of legislative provisions may not always reflect practical\n\nrealities.  It is important that resources should be made available and that they should be\n\nutilised properly, so that the values expressed in the Constitution may be upheld and\n\nmaintained.  It bears mentioning that although changes in the criminal justice system have\n\nbeen occurring, albeit at a painfully slow pace, there has been a perceptible shift in\n\napproach and attitude towards punishment.   I mention three aspects of this process: \n\n[65]\n\n(a)\n\nThere has been a shift of emphasis with regard to the overall aims of punishment.\n\n There is a general acceptance, as observed by Schreiner JA in R v Karg,78 that the\n\nretributive  aspect  has  tended  to  give  way    to  the  aspects  of  prevention  and\n\ncorrection.  New and innovative systems and procedures have been introduced and\n\nsome of them have been incorporated into legislation.  The traditional objectives\n\nof punishment, namely, prevention, retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation, are\n\nno  doubt  still  applicable.      Still  applicable,  albeit  in  modified  form,  are  the\n\nremarks of Holmes JA that:\n\n\"Punishment should fit the criminal as well as the\ncrime, be fair to the accused and to society, and be\nblended with a measure of mercy ... the element of\nmercy,  a  hallmark  of  civilised  and  enlightened\nadministration, should not be overlooked, lest the\nCourt be in danger of reducing itself to the plane of\nthe criminal ... \"79\n\n     78 1961(1) SA 231(A) at 236A.\n\n     79 S v V 1972(3) SA 611(A) at 614D.\n\n\f25\n\n[66]\n\nWhile those principles have remained eternal truths with regard to the purposes of\n\npunishment, the justice and penal systems have been evolving towards a more\n\nenlightened and humane implementation of those principles.   In keeping with\n\ninternational trends, there has been a gradual shift of emphasis away from the idea\n\nof sentencing being predominantly the arena where society wreaks its vengeance\n\non wrongdoers.   Sentences have been passed with rehabilitation in mind.\n\n[67]\n\nThe introduction of correctional supervision with its prime focus on rehabilitation,\n\nthrough section 276 of the Act, was a milestone in the process of \"humanising\" the\n\ncriminal  justice  system.      It  brought  along  with  it  the  possibility  of  several\n\nimaginative  sentencing  measures  including,  but  not  limited  to,  house  arrest,\n\nmonitoring, community service and placement in employment.  This assisted in the\n\nshift  of  emphasis  from  retribution  to  rehabilitation.  This  development  was\n\nrecognised and hailed by Kriegler AJA in S v R80  as being the introduction of a\n\nnew phase in our criminal justice system allowing for the imposition of finely-\n\ntuned sentences without resorting to imprisonment with all its known disadvantages\n\nfor both the prisoner and the broader community.\n\n[68]\n\nThe development of this process must not be seen as a weakness, as the justice\n\nsystem having \"gone soft.\"  What it entails is the application of appropriate and\n\neffective sentences.   An enlightened society will punish offenders, but will do so\n\nwithout sacrificing  decency and human dignity.\n\n[69]\n\n(b)\n\nThere is growing interest in moves to develop a new juvenile justice system. This\n\nimpacts directly on the availability of sentencing options for juveniles.  It has been\n\na matter of comment that juveniles were being sentenced to whipping on the basis\n\nthat it was the only alternative to a prison sentence.  Judges have, in the past,\n\nindicated  their distaste for juvenile whipping; they have, however, tolerated and\n\nconfirmed  the  sentences  purely  as  a  device  to  avoid  imprisoning  juvenile\n\noffenders.\n\n     80 1993(1) SA 476 (A) at 488I.\n\n\f[70]\n\nIn S v Maseti Conradie J observed that the view that whipping should be imposed\n\nas a device to keep juveniles out of prison was fallacious:\n\n26\n\n\"  ...  [r]egsbeamptes  laat  jong  mans  slaan  omdat\ndaar met ons beperkte middele, infrastrukture en\nvonnisopsies, net geen ander raad met hulle is nie\n . . .   Maar dat die veroorsaking van pyn en leed 'n\nonbevredigende  vonnisopsie  is,  weet  ons  algar\nlankal.\u201d81\n\nNoting that new sentencing options had been introduced into the criminal justice\n\nsystem, he voiced the hope that they would be creatively and effectively used.82 \n\n[71]\n\nJuvenile whipping, however, has not invariably met with judicial disapproval.  In\n\nS v Vakalisa,83 Mitchell J  referred to remarks in S v V en 'n Ander84 in which MT\n\nSteyn  JA  dealt  at  length  with  the  undesirability  of  corporal  punishment  and\n\ndescribed it as \"extremely humiliating and physically painful.\u201d  Mitchell J went on\n\nto observe:\n\n\"Whatever may be the South African view of this\nkind  of  punishment  [juvenile  whipping],  the\nTranskeian lawgiver has taken a different view of\nthe desirability of corporal punishment in respect\nof juveniles even, as I have mentioned, specifically\nproviding for the whipping of female juveniles, a\nsentence  which  is  frequently  applied  in  various\nmagisterial districts of Transkei.   I would have\nthought  that  it  is  far  more  important  to  keep\njuveniles  out  of  gaol  where  the  appropriate\ncircumstances exist, to save them the association\nwith adult convicted criminals, than to shy away\nfrom the imposition of a 'juvenile whipping'. This\nis particularly true in Transkei when, if a juvenile\n\n     81 Supra note 74, at 464 I-J.\n\n     82 Supra note 74, at 464J-465A.\n\n     83 1990(2) SACR 88 (Tk) at 94G-J.\n\n     84 Supra note 5.\n\n\f27\n\nis sent to prison, he cannot be sent to one for first\noffenders  only,  or  to  one  where  juveniles  are\neffectively kept apart from adult criminals, for no\nsuch facilities yet exist in this country.\"85   \n\n[72]\n\nApart from drawing attention to the distressing fact that some legislation still\n\npermitted the whipping of females, Mitchell J's remarks in fact summarised what\n\nturned  out  to  be  the  central  argument  proffered  by  the  State  in  favour  of  the\n\nretention of juvenile whipping.  If the option of corporal punishment is taken away,\n\nso we were warned, many juveniles who would not otherwise have been sent to\n\ngaol would now have to be imprisoned.\n\n[73]\n\nPickering J's approach in  S v Sikunyana  86 appears to be more helpful in that it\n\ngives  implicit  recognition  to  alternative  correctional  supervision  sentencing\n\noptions and the need for courts not to be \"unduly hamstrung\" by administrative and\n\nother difficulties in implementing community service orders.87  It would therefore\n\nseem that notwithstanding the daunting problems highlighted by Mitchell J in 1990,\n\nthe prospects for more enlightened sentencing options have improved.  \n\n[74]\n\nTo the extent that facilities and physical resources may not always be adequate, it\n\nseems to me that the new dynamic should be regarded as a timely challenge to the\n\nState to ensure the provision and execution of an effective juvenile justice system.\n\nThe  wider range of penalties now provided for in the Act88  permits  a  more\n\nflexible but effective approach in dealing with juvenile offenders.\n\n     85 Supra note 83, at 94I-J.\n\n     86 1994(1) SACR 206 (Tk).\n\n     87 Id. at 210G.\n\n     88  In addition to the provisions of section 290(supra), a juvenile may also be dealt with in terms of other\nsections of the Act, such as, section 287 [fine]; section 297(1)(a- c) [postponing sentence conditionally or\nunconditionally,  suspended sentence subject to conditions; caution and discharge]; sections 276(1)(h) and 276A\n[correctional supervision]; and converting the trial to an enquiry in terms of the Child Care Act No. 74 of 1983.\n The latter course has 4 options, namely: (i) placing the child in the custody of a suitable foster parent; (ii) sending\nthe child to a designated children's home; (iii) sending the child to a designated school of industries; (iv) returning\nthe child to the parent or guardian, under   ... supervision of a social worker.\n\n\f[75]\n\nThere is indeed much room for new creative methods to deal with the problem of\n\n28\n\njuvenile justice.  During argument, we were informed that  interesting sentencing\n\noptions were being increasingly applied in the Western Cape and that Conradie J\u2019s\n\nsuggestion to magistrates was a further encouragement to the process.  There are,\n\nfor  instance,  community  service  orders  which  are  linked  to  suspended  or\n\npostponed  sentences.    These  are  structured  in  such  a  way  that  they  meet  the\n\npunitive element of sentencing while allowing for the education and rehabilitation\n\nof the offender.   There is also the victim-offender mediation process in terms of\n\nwhich the victim is enabled to participate in the justice process, receive restitution\n\nwhile the offender is assisted to rehabilitate.  There are sentences which are\n\nsuspended on condition that the offender attends a juvenile offender school for a\n\nspecific purpose. These orders are structured in such a way that they yield benefits\n\nto the victim of the crime, the offender and to the community.   Doubtless these\n\nprocesses, still in their infancy, can be developed through involvement by State\n\nand non-governmental agencies and institutions which are involved in juvenile\n\njustice projects.\n\n[76]\n\n(c)  \n\nThe enactment of the Constitution has created a framework within which significant\n\nchanges can be brought about in the criminal justice system.   The rights entrenched\n\nin Chapter 3 are available to \"every person\";  that includes children and adults,\n\nwomen and men, prisoners and detainees.   The Constitution clearly places a very\n\nhigh premium on human dignity and the protection against punishments that are\n\ncruel, inhuman or degrading;  very stringent requirements would have to be met by\n\nthe State before these rights can be limited.\n\n[77]\n\nIn addressing itself specifically to punishment, the Constitution  ensures that the\n\nsentencing  of  offenders  must  conform  to  standards  of  decency  recognised\n\nthroughout the civilised word.   Thus it sets a  norm;  measures that assail the\n\ndignity and self esteem of an individual will need to be justified; there is no place\n\nfor  brutal  and  dehumanising  treatment  and  punishment.    The  Constitution  has\n\nallocated to the State and its organs a role as the protectors and guarantors of those\n\n\f29\n\nrights to ensure that they are available to all.   In the process, it sets the State up as\n\na model for society as it endeavours to move away from a violent past.  It is\n\ntherefore reasonable to expect that the State must be foremost in upholding those\n\nvalues which are the guiding light of civilised societies.   Respect for human\n\ndignity is one such value; acknowledging it includes an acceptance by society that\n\n\" . . .even the vilest criminal remains a human being possessed of common human\n\ndignity.\"89  \n\n[78]\n\nThe State sought to strengthen its argument by pointing out the comparative convenience\n\nof juvenile whipping as a punishment: it satisfied criteria for punishment, while at the same\n\ntime affording the courts a reasonable sentencing option; it was not too harsh for young\n\noffenders, but it enabled them to \"get it over and done with\" quickly.  In this context, we\n\nwere informed that parents often asked for this punishment to be imposed. \n\n[79] While there are obvious advantages to \"quick\" justice, society's greater concern must be\n\nthe form such punishment takes.   The solutions we adopt in dealing with young offenders\n\nhave to be part of a greater context and must be consistent with the promotion of the values\n\nwhich are reflected in the Constitution.   It cannot be reasonable and in keeping with these\n\nvalues to imply, through the punishments we impose, that the infliction of violence is an\n\nacceptable option in the solution of problems.  In any event, this consideration falls far\n\nshort of the justification required to entitle the State to override the prohibition against the\n\ninfliction of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.   Its implications for the dignity of\n\nthe individual are also far too serious. \n\n    \n\n[80]\n\nThe State stressed the deterrent nature of juvenile whipping.  Deterrence is, obviously, a\n\nlegitimate objective which the State may pursue.  We live in a crime-ridden society; the\n\ncourts and other relevant organs of the State have a duty to make crime unattractive to those\n\nwho are inclined to embark  on that course.  The concerns which the provision seeks to\n\naddress are indeed pressing and they are substantial.  But, as already stated, the means\n\nemployed must be reasonable and demonstrably justifiable.  No clear evidence has been\n\n     89 Brennan J in Furman v Georgia supra note 36, at 273.\n\n\f30\n\nadvanced that  juvenile whipping is a more effective deterrent than other available forms\n\nof punishment.  \n\n[81]\n\nIn  1960  the  Advisory  Council  on  the  Treatment  of  Offenders  reviewed  the  decision\n\nabolishing corporal punishment in the United Kingdom,  which had been taken pursuant to\n\nthe Cadogan Report of 1938.90  The Council  pointed out that \"[t]here is no evidence that\n\ncorporal punishment is an especially effective deterrent either to those who have received\n\nit or to others.\"91  It therefore arrived at the unanimous conclusion that judicial corporal\n\npunishment should not be re-introduced.  In  S v Motsoesoana Page J, in an exhaustive\n\nanalysis of the law in relation to corporal punishment,  arrived at the conclusion that\n\ncorporal punishment serves no useful deterrent function, on the contrary, \u201cits effect is likely\n\nto be coarsening and degrading rather than rehabilitative.\"92   In his judgment he also\n\nreferred to an article by Professor Kahn on Crime and Punishment 1910-1960:\n\n\"Even making the utmost allowances for extraneous factors such as\nchanges in population and in the efficiency of the police force and\nprosecuting authorities, it seems reasonable to conclude that the\ndeterrent effect of compulsory whipping is nowhere to be seen. If\nthis is so, its retention can only be atributed to some spirit of\nretribution or revenge.\" 93 \n\n[82]\n\nIt may be relevant to observe that three of the applicants in this matter had previous\n\nconvictions for which they had received strokes; one of them, Witbooi, had in fact received\n\nfive strokes a mere five months before the present sentence.  Some of the co-accused had\n\na variety of previous convictions for which they had received sentences which included\n\nstrokes.  One of them, namely  Thomas, had already received a total of sixteen strokes.\n\nThe previous punishment has obviously failed to act as a sufficient deterrent in these cases.\n\n[83]\n\nI am, however, prepared to accept that there is some deterrent value in juvenile whippings.\n\n As Milne JP observed in  S v Kumalo and Others it could be expected that:\n\n     90 See S v Motsoesoana supra note 12, at 353F-G.\n\n     91 Id. at 353I.\n\n     92 Id. at 354D-F.\n\n     93 Id. at 352I-J: article published in 1960 Acta Juridica 191 at 211-2.\n\n\f31\n\n\" . . .  the thought of a severe whipping, whether as a result of\nexperience  or  only  of  an  act  of  imagination,  could  well  have\ndeterred very many, although it is all too evident that very many\nhave not thereby been deterred.\"94  \n\n \n\n \n\n[84] What  has  not  been  shown  is  that  such  deterrent  value  as  might  exist  is  sufficiently\n\nsignificant to enable  the State to override a right entrenched in the Constitution.   All\n\nindications are to the contrary.   While juvenile whipping has a brutalising effect, it has not\n\nbeen  shown  that  it  has  the  capacity  to  deter  more  than  other  punishments  would  do.\n\nMoreover, I  agree  with the remarks of Fannin J in S v Kumalo and Others: \n\n\"Within comparatively recent times corporal punishment of quite\nhorrifying severity were inflicted for a great number of offences,\nand I, for one do not believe that the general deterrent effect of such\npunishments  justified  the  suffering  and  indignity  which  were\ninflicted upon those who were so punished.  I am of the opinion\nthat a whipping is a punishment of a particularly severe kind.  It is\nbrutal in its nature and constitutes a severe assault upon not only\nthe person of the recipient but upon his dignity as a human being.\nThe severity of the punishment depends, to a very large extent,\nupon  the  personality  of  the  officer  charged  with  the  duty  of\ninflicting it, and over that the court ordering the punishment can\nhave little, if any, control.\"95\n\n[85] Howie AJA, quite correctly in my view, warned against the idea that the accused should\n\nbe sacrificed on the altar of deterrence.96    To this I would add that this is even more so\n\nwhen the court is dealing with a youthful  offender. \n\n[86]\n\nIf, as I have found, the deterrence value is so marginal that it does not justify the imposition\n\nof this special punishment, involving as it does the deliberate infliction of physical pain,\n\none has to conclude that the sole reason for retaining it is to satisfy society's need for\n\nretribution.   While retribution is, in itself, a legitimate element of punishment, it is not the\n\nonly one; it should not be the overriding one.  It cannot, on its own, justify the existence of\n\n     94 Supra note 7, at 571H.\n\n     95 Id. at 574 E-H.\n\n     96 See S v Sobandla 1992(2) SACR 613(A) at 617G.\n\n\fthe punishment. \n\n32\n\n[87]\n\nIt needs to be stressed that it is in the interests of justice that crime should be punished. As\n\npointed out by Schreiner JA in R v Karg:\n\n \n\n\"It is not wrong that the natural indignation of interested persons\nand of the community at large should receive some recognition in\nthe sentences that courts impose, and it is not irrelevant to bear in\nmind  that  if  sentences  for  serious  crimes  are  too  lenient,  the\nadministration  of  justice  may  fall  into  disrepute  and  injured\npersons may incline to take the law into their own hands.\"97\n\n[88] However, punishment that is excessive serves neither the interests of justice nor those of\n\nsociety.  According to Brennan J,98 punishment is excessive if it is unnecessary, and it is\n\nunnecessary \u201cif there is a significantly less severe punishment adequate to achieve the\n\npurposes for which the punishment is inflicted.\u201d    In  Gregg v Georgia,99  Stewart  J,\n\ndescribed the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain as an aspect of excessiveness.\n\n[89]\n\nFinally, the perceived advantages or benefits of juvenile whipping must be weighed\n\nagainst the rights which the provision seeks to limit.  Corporal punishment involves the\n\nintentional infliction of physical pain on a human being by another human being at the\n\ninstigation of the State.  This is the key feature distinguishing it from other punishments.\n\nThe degree of pain inflicted is quite arbitrary, depending as it does on the person who is\n\ndelegated to do the whipping.   The court merely directs the number of strokes to be\n\nimposed.   The objective must be to penetrate the levels of tolerance to pain; the result\n\nmust be a cringing fear, a terror of expectation before the whipping and acute distress\n\nwhich often draws involuntary screams during the infliction.   There is no dignity in the act\n\nitself; the recipient might struggle against himself to maintain a semblance of dignified\n\nsuffering  or  even  unconcern;  there  is  no  dignity  even  in  the  person  delivering  the\n\n     97 Supra note 78, at 236A-B.\n\n     98 Furman supra note 36, at 279.\n\n     99 Supra note 38, at 173.   \n\n\fpunishment.  It is a practice which debases everyone involved in it.\n\n33\n\n[90]\n\nI  have  already  referred  to  the  dictionary  meaning  of  the  words  \"cruel,  inhuman  or\n\ndegrading.\u201d      Conduct  which  fits  any  one  of  the  adjectives  is  therefore  hit  by  the\n\nprohibition.  I however do not see any compelling reason to confine the conduct impugned\n\nto one adjective only.  The deliberate infliction of pain with a cane on a tender part of the\n\nbody as well as the institutionalised nature of the procedure involves an element of cruelty\n\nin  the  system  that  sanctions  it.    The  activity  is  planned  beforehand,  it  is  deliberate.\n\nWhether the person administering the strokes has a cruel streak or not is beside the point.\n\nIt could hardly be claimed, in a physical sense at least, that the act pains him more than his\n\nvictim. The act is impersonal, executed by a stranger, in alien surroundings.  The juvenile\n\nis, indeed, treated as an object and not as a human being. As pointed out in  Jackson v\n\nBishop:\n\n \n\n   \n\n\". . . irrespective of any precautionary conditions which may be\nimposed, [it] offends contemporary concepts of decency and human\ndignity  and  precepts  of  civilisation  which  we  profess  to\npossess...\"100\n\n[91] No compelling interest has been proved which can justify the practice.  It has not been\n\nshown that there are no other punishments which are adequate to achieve the purposes for\n\nwhich it is imposed. Nor has it been shown to be a significantly effective deterrent. On the\n\nother hand, as observed by  Page J in S v Motsoesoana,101    its  effect  is  likely  to  be\n\ncoarsening and degrading rather than rehabilitative.  It is moreover also unnecessary. \n\nMany countries in the civilised world abolished it long ago; there are enough sentencing\n\noptions in our justice system to conclude that whipping does not have to be resorted to.\n\nThus,  whether  one  looks  at  the  adjectives  disjunctively  or  regards  the  phrase  as  a\n\n\"compendious expression of a norm\",  it is my view that at this time, so close to the dawn\n\nof the 21st century, juvenile whipping is cruel, it is inhuman and it is degrading.  It cannot,\n\nmoreover, be justified in terms of section 33(1) of the Constitution. \n\n     100 Supra note 51 at 579.\n\n     101 Supra note 12 at 354F.\n\n\f34\n\n[92]\n\nI accordingly find that the provisions of section 294 of the Act violate the provisions of\n\nsections 10 and 11(2) of the Constitution and that they cannot be saved by the operation of\n\nsection 33(1) of the Constitution.  Although the provision concerned is a law of general\n\napplication, the limitation it imposes on the rights in question is, in the light of all the\n\ncircumstances, not reasonable,  not justifiable and it is furthermore not necessary.  The\n\nprovisions are therefore unconstitutional.  \n\n  \n\n[93]\n\nIt becomes unnecessary to embark on an investigation to determine whether or not the\n\nprovision in fact negates the essential content of any of the rights involved. \n\n[94]\n\nIn the light of this finding, I do not find it necessary to debate the issue whether section 294\n\nof the Act also infringes the other provisions of the Constitution, namely sections 8 and 30.\n\n[95]\n\nThere may well be cases where juveniles have been sentenced in terms of section 294 of\n\nthe Act but where the sentences have, for some reason or other, not yet been carried out.\n\nIt follows from the finding of this Court that such sentences will have to be set aside by the\n\ncourts having jurisdiction to do so and new sentences substituted.\n\n[96]\n\nThe following order is accordingly made:\n\n1.\n\nThe following provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act No. 51 of 1977 (as\n\namended) are inconsistent with the Repbulic of South Africa Constitution Act No.\n\n200 of 1993 (as amended) and are, with effect from the date of this order, declared\n\nto be invalid and of no force and effect:\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nsection 294 in its entirety; and\n\nthe words \u201cor a whipping\u201d in section 290(2).\n\n2.\n\nIn terms of section 98(7) of the Constitution, it is ordered that with effect\n\nfrom the date of this order, no sentences imposed in terms of section 294\n\nof the Criminal Procedure Act No. 51 of 1977, shall be carried out.\n\n\f35\n\n3.\n\nThe matter of State v Williams (Review No. 53/94) is referred back to the\n\nCape of Good Hope Provincial Division for an appropriate order.\n\n                                                     \nP N Langa\nJudge of the Constitutional Court\n\nChaskalson P, Ackermann J, Didcott J, Kentridge AJ, Kriegler J, Madala J, Mahomed J, Mokgoro\nJ, O\u2019Regan J and Sachs J all concur in the judgment of Langa J.\n\n\fCASE NUMBER:\n\nCOUNSEL ON BEHALF OF\nTHE ACCUSED:\n\nINSTRUCTED BY:\n\nCOUNSEL FOR THE STATE:\n\nDATE OF HEARING:\n\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:\n\nCCT/20/94\n\nL J Bozalek\n\nP Hathorn\n\nS P Kahanovitz\nLegal Resources Centre, Cape Town\n\nJ Slabbert\n\n24 March 1995\n\n9 June 1995\n\n\f"}, "id": "d6040765-54b1-472f-989a-6620e08045e2", "update_date": "2021-03-15 17:08:56.815502", "year": "1995"}, {"title": "Coetzee v Government of the Republic of South Africa, Matiso and Others v Commanding Officer Port Elizabeth Prison and Others (CCT19/94 , CCT22/94) [1995] ZACC 7; 1995 (10) BCLR 1382; 1995 (4) SA 631 (22 September 1995)", "url": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1995/7.html", "summary_document": {"filename": "summary-for-case-7.pdf", "file_url": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1995/7media.pdf", "file_content": "Coetzee v Government of The Republic of South Africa \n\n \n\n                                                                                                           Case CCT 19/94 \n\nExplanatory Note  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nThe following explanation is provided to assist the media in reporting this case and is not \nbinding on the Constitutional Court or any member of the Court. \n \n\nSections 65A to 65M of the Magistrates Courts Act 32 of 1944 provide for the imprisonment \nof judgment debtors. A judgment debtor who has failed to satisfy the judgment debt within 10 \ndays of the date of the judgment can be required to attend a hearing at which an enquiry will \nbe conducted by a magistrate into the financial position of the debtor, his or her ability to pay \nand his or her failure to do so. Notice to the debtor to appear at a hearing calls upon the \ndebtor to show cause why he or she should not be committed for contempt of court and why \nthe judgment debtor should not be ordered to pay the judgment debt in instalments or \notherwise. The notice is drawn up by the creditor, signed by the clerk of the court and served \non the debtor in accordance with the rules for service of process. The magistrate has a \ndiscretion whether to order committal to prison unless the debtor proves at the hearing that he \nor she 1) is under the age of 18, 2) was unaware of the original judgment for debt against him \nor her, or 3) has no means of satisfying the judgment debt. In order to show absence of means \nof satisfying the judgment debt the debtor also must show that such lack of means is not due \nto wilful disposal of goods in order to avoid payment of the judgment debt, wilful refusal to \npay such debt, squandering of money or living beyond his or her means, or incurring of \nadditional debts (except for household goods) after the original judgment date.  \n\nIn two separate cases divisions of the Supreme Court referred the question of the \nconstitutionality of ss 65A to 65M of the Magistrates Courts Act to the Constitutional Court.  \n\nThe Court held that the provisions violated the right to freedom and security of the person \ncontained in s 11(1) of the Constitution. It was considered certain that to put someone in \nprison is a limitation of that person's right to freedom. To do so without any criminal charge \nbeing levelled or any trial being held is manifestly a radical encroachment on that right.  \n\nAs to the question of the justifiability of the limitation in terms of s 33(1) of the Constitution, \nit was held that at the very least a law or action limiting the right to freedom must have a \nreasonable goal and the means for achieving that goal must also be reasonable. The goal of ss \n65A to 65M of the Magistrates Courts Act is to provide a mechanism for the enforcement of \njudgment debts. This goal is a legitimate and reasonable government objective. The means \nfor achieving this objective were however not considered reasonable by the Court. The \nprovisions are held to be overbroad. The sanction of imprisonment is ostensibly aimed at the \ndebtor who will not pay. But it is unreasonable in that it also strikes at those who cannot pay \nand simply fail to prove this at a hearing often due to negative circumstances created by the \nprovisions themselves. Due to a number of defects, the statute sweeps up those who cannot \npay with those who can but simply will not. The provisions allow persons to be imprisoned \nwithout having actual notice of either the original judgment or of the hearing. It is not only \ntheoretically possible but also quite possible in practice that the debtor's first notice of the \n\n1 \n\n\fcase against him or her is when the warrant of committal is executed, since personal service \nof any process prior to that is not required. Even if a person has notice of the hearing, he or \nshe can be imprisoned without knowing of the possible defences available and accordingly \nwithout any attempt to advance any of those defences. The so-called notice to show cause \nissued pursuant to s 65A does not spell out what the defences are, or how they could be \nestablished. The burden cast on the debtor with regard to inability to pay, although possibly \ndefensible in principle as pertaining to matters peculiarly within his or her knowledge, is so \nwidely couched that persons genuinely unable to pay are nevertheless struck. The provisions \nof s 65F(3)(c), which spell out what the debtor must prove, are not only unreasonably wide, \nbut also unreasonably punitive. Whatever may be said about a debtor who wilfully frustrates \npayment, the nakedly punitive retribution inherent in the provisions of paragraphs (iii) and \n(iv) cannot be justified. The provisions allow debtors to be imprisoned without knowing that \nthey have a burden to prove their defence or how to discharge such burden. It could possibly \nbe contended that the magistrate ought to explain a debtor's rights and duties to an \nundefended debtor and would probably do so. But there is no express obligation on the \nmagistrate to do so.  \n\nThe Court considered it indefensible to treat a civil judgment debtor more harshly than a \ncriminal. The latter is entitled in terms of s 25(3) of the Constitution to a fair trial with \nprocedural safeguards, including the right to legal assistance at public expense if justice so \nrequires. The debtors, who face months of imprisonment, must fend for themselves as best \nthey can. The procedure makes no provision for recourse by the debtor to the magistrate or \nhigher authority once an order for committal has been made. Section 65L, which deals with \nthe release of a debtor from prison, contains no mechanism whereby a debtor, even one \nagainst whom a committal order had been made in absentia, is entitled to approach a court for \nrelief.  \n\nThe Court considered that was not possible to excise only those provisions of the Magistrates \nCourts Act which fail to distinguish between debtors who cannot pay and debtors who will \nnot pay. In order to do so the Court would have to engage in the details of law making, a \nconstitutional activity given to the legislature. It was, however, considered possible to sever \nthe provisions which make up the option of imprisonment. The object of sections 65A to 65M \nof the Magistrates Courts Act was to provide a system to assist in the collection of judgment \ndebts. Removing one of the options available under the system did not make the system that \nremains run contrary to the purpose of the legislative scheme. Accordingly, the infringing \nprovisions could be severed and the balance of the system could usefully remain in force.  \n\nThe Court therefore struck out certain provisions of the Magistrates Court Act providing for \nimprisonment of judgment debtors. All other provisions of sections 65A to 65M of the \nMagistrates Courts Act remained in force. With effect from the date of the Court's order, the \ncommittal or continuing imprisonment of any judgment debtor in terms of section 65F or 65G \nof the Magistrates Courts Act was declared invalid.  \n\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Kriegler J (Chaskalson P, Mahomed DP, \nAckermann J, Madala J, O'Regan J and Kentridge AJ concurring). Mokgoro J concurred in \nthe order proposed by Kriegler J. Didcott J delivered a separate judgment, expressing \nagreement with the judgment and order of Kriegler J but dissenting as to the extent to which \nthe invalid parts of the Act were severable from the valid parts. Langa J delivered a separate \njudgement , concurring in the order proposed by Kriegler J and concurring with the judgment \nof Kriegler J and with the judgment of Didcott J. Sachs J delivered a separate judgment \n\n2 \n\n\fconcurring with the judgments of Kriegler J and Didcott J and with the order proposed by \nKriegler J.

The applicant was soon followed by a number of other\n\njudgment debtors in the same predicament.  The foundation of the applications was that\n\nthe statutory authority of the orders committing the particular debtors to prison had been\n\nvitiated by sections 11(1) and 25(3) of the Constitution.  Those subsections, it was\n\nargued, made imprisonment without a fair trial unconstitutional.  Although they cited the\n\ncommanding officer of the prison and their respective judgment creditors as\n\nrespondents, there was no opposition.\n\n[ 3 ]\n\nThe judges who heard the applications (Melunsky and Froneman JJ) ordered the\n\nimmediate release of the prisoners and referred the challenge to the constitutionality of\n\nthe allegedly offending provisions of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act to this Court.3 \n\n1No. 32 of 1944.

The Court (per Van Reenen AJ) stayed committal\n\nproceedings pending against Ms Coetzee and referred the constitutional validity of\n\nsections 65A to 65M to this Court for determination.5  Although the formulation of the\n\nconstitutional issues in the orders in the Eastern Cape case differs somewhat from that\n\nof Van Reenen AJ, the essential issue is one and the same:  Is the procedure in the\n\nsections mentioned wholly or partially invalid for inconsistency with one or more of\n\nthe rights guaranteed in Chapter 3 and circumscribed by section 33(1) of the\n\nConstitution?\n\n[ 5 ]\n\nI have had the opportunity of considering the judgments prepared by my\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n\nthe whole of sections 65F, 65G, 65H and 65L;\nsubsections (1)(c), (2)(b)(ii), 9(a) and 9(b) of s 65J; and\nsection 65K(2).\n\n4The judgments have been reported as Matiso and Others v The Commanding Officer, Port Elizabeth\n\nPrison and Others 1994(3) BCLR 80(SE); 1994(4) SA 592 (SECLD).\n\n5The learned judge formulated the constitutional question as follows:\n\nAre sections 65A to 65M of the Magistrates' Courts Act, No 32 of 1994, as\namended, or any parts of the said Sections, invalid on the ground of their\ninconsistency with Sections 10, 11 and 25 of the Constitution of the Republic\nof South Africa Act, No 200 of 1993, or any other provision of the said\nConstitution?\n\n3\n\n\fKRIEGLER J\n\ncolleagues Didcott and Sachs JJ in these cases.  Each of them makes quite plain why the\n\nprovisions of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act relating to the imprisonment of judgment\n\ndebtors for contempt of court6 must be held to be invalid by reason of their\n\ninconsistency with the Constitution.  Although I fully agree with that finding, my\n\nreasoning is sufficiently different to warrant separate articulation.  The grounds for my\n\nconclusion are considerably narrower than those set out in the judgment of Sachs J;7 and\n\nthere is some difference of emphasis as between Didcott J and myself.\n\n[ 6 ]\n\nSections 65A to 65M of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act provide a system for the\n\nenforcement of judgment debts.  Under the system a judgment debtor who has failed to\n\nsatisfy the judgment debt within 10 days of the date of the judgment can be required to\n\nattend a hearing8 at which an enquiry will be conducted by a magistrate into the\n\nfinancial position of the debtor, his ability to pay and his failure to do so.9  The\n\nmagistrate may authorise property of or debts due to the judgment debtor to be attached\n\nin settlement of all or part of the debt, or the garnishing of emoluments which will\n\naccrue to the debtor from his or her employment.  The debtor can also be ordered to\n\n6In my view, it is not important whether the system is termed imprisonment for contempt of court for not\npaying a debt or civil imprisonment or some other word or phrase.  The task of this Court is to determine whether\nthe system, whatever it may be called, is or is not consistent with the Constitution. \n\n7Because I base my decision on the examination of the specific provisions of the sections at issue and\nnot the overall concept of imprisonment for failure to pay a judgment debt, I do not find it necessary in this\njudgment to comment on the procedures of other countries used for the enforcement of judgment debts or the\njudicial decisions regarding such procedures.  Nor do I find it necessary to consider the impact of the international\nhuman rights instruments so instructively canvassed by Sachs J. \n\n8See Sections 65A and 65B of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act.  The notice to the judgment debtor must be\n\nserved at least 7 days prior to the hearing.  Section 65B of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act. \n\n9See Section 65D of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act.  In determining the ability of the debtor to pay, the\nmagistrate is required to take into account the debtor\u2019s and his dependants\u2019 necessary expenses, other court orders\nto pay, and other commitments of the debtor.  Section 65D(4)(a) of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act.  \n\n4\n\n\fKRIEGLER J\n\npay the debt in full or in instalments.10  The system does not end there, however.  It also\n\nprovides for the magistrate to issue an order to commit the judgment debtor to prison\n\nfor contempt of court for failure to pay the debt.11  This last option of the magistrate is\n\nthe issue which has given rise to the constitutional challenge.\n\n[ 7 ]\n\nThe notice to the debtor to appear at a hearing calls upon the debtor to \u201cshow\n\ncause why he should not be committed for contempt of court and why the judgment\n\ndebtor should not be ordered to pay the judgment debt in instalments or otherwise.\u201d12 \n\nThe notice is drawn up by the creditor, signed by the clerk of the court and served on\n\nthe debtor in accordance with the rules for service of process.13  The magistrate has a\n\ndiscretion whether to order committal to prison unless the debtor proves at the hearing\n\nthat he or she 1) is under the age of 18, 2) was unaware of the original judgment for\n\ndebt against him, or 3) has no means of satisfying the judgment debt.  In order to show\n\nabsence of means of satisfying the judgment debt the debtor also must show that such\n\nlack of means is not due to wilful disposal of goods in order to avoid payment of the\n\njudgment debt, wilful refusal to pay such debt, squandering of money or living beyond\n\nhis means, or incurring of additional debts (except for household goods) after the\n\noriginal judgment date.14 \n\n10See Section 65E of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act.\n\n11See Section 65F of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act.  The magistrate may also suspend a sentence for\n\ncommittal.  Section 65F(2) of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act.\n\n12Section 65A(1) of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act.\n\n13Section 65B of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act.  In accordance with the rules of service the notice need\n\nnot be served personally.  Rule 9 of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Rules.\n\n14Section 65F(3) of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act.\n\n5\n\n\fKRIEGLER J\n\n[ 8 ]\n\nOn the face of it, the law seems to contemplate that imprisonment should be\n\nordered only where the debtor has the means to pay the debt, but is unwilling to do so. \n\nHowever, on examination of the provisions in detail and taking notice of the actual\n\ncarrying out of the provisions, it is clear that the law does not adequately distinguish\n\nbetween the fundamentally different categories of judgment debtors: those who cannot\n\npay and those who can pay but do not want to.  The system at issue is used most often\n\nfor the collection of small debts usually of those who are poor and either illiterate or\n\nuninformed about the law or both.  In the nature of things they do not enjoy legal\n\nrepresentation.  Imprisonment can and has been ordered without the debtor ever having\n\nnotice of the original judgment or the notice to appear at the hearing.  It can also be\n\nordered without the uninformed or illiterate debtor having sufficient knowledge about\n\nthe possibility of raising defences or the means of doing so.  In the result, the provisions\n\nof the law can be used to imprison the debtor who is unwilling to pay his debt even\n\nthough he has the means to do so, but can also be used (and they are indeed used) to\n\nimprison the debtor who simply is unable to pay the debt.15\n\n15South African Law Commission, Debt Collecting (Project 74): Imprisonment for Debt, Interim Report\n\ndated August 1994 at paragraph 4.2.2.\n\n6\n\n\f[ 9 ]\n\nThis Court has laid down that, ordinarily, one adopts a two-stage approach for\n\nKRIEGLER J\n\ndetermining the constitutionality of alleged violations of rights in Chapter 3 of the\n\nConstitution.  The first stage is an enquiry whether the disputed legislation or other\n\ngovernmental action limits rights in Chapter 3 of the Constitution.  If so, the second\n\nstage calls for a decision whether the limitation can be justified in terms of section\n\n33(1) of the Constitution.16\n\n[ 10 ]\n\nThe first question this Court must answer therefore is whether any of the rights\n\nin Chapter 3 of the Constitution are limited by the relevant provisions of the\n\nMagistrates\u2019 Courts Act.  The parties argued with regard to the right to dignity (section\n\n10), the right to freedom (section 11(1)) and the right to a fair trial (section 25(3)). \n\nObviously the most fundamental right limited by imprisonment is the right to freedom. \n\nSection 11(1) of the Constitution provides:\n\n11. (1) Every person shall have the right to freedom and security of the\nperson, which shall include the right not to be detained without trial.\n\nTo determine whether that right is limited by the legislative provisions under scrutiny in\n\nthese cases, it really is not necessary to determine the outer boundaries of the right. \n\nNor is it necessary to examine the philosophical foundation or the precise content of the\n\nright.  Certainly to put someone in prison is a limitation of that person\u2019s right to\n\nfreedom. 17  To do so without any criminal charge being levelled or any trial being held\n\n16See, e.g., S v Williams and Others 1995(7) BCLR 861 (CC), 879D-G.\n\n17It is not necessary to address whether the rights in sections 10 and 25(3) are limited.  It would only\nbecome necessary to do so should analysis of the limitation with regard to the right to freedom in accordance with\n\n7\n\n\fis manifestly a radical encroachment upon such right. \n\nKRIEGLER J\n\n[ 11 ]\n\nThe remaining question then is whether that limitation of the right to freedom\n\ncan be justified in accordance with section 33(1) of the Constitution.  That subsection,\n\ninsofar as it is relevant here, provides:\n\n33. Limitation. (1) The rights entrenched in this Chapter may be limited by\nlaw of general application, provided that such limitation\n\n(a) shall be permissible only to the extent that it is\n\n(i) reasonable; and \n(ii) justifiable in an open and democratic society\nbased on freedom and equality; and\n\n(b) shall not negate the essential content of the right in\nquestion, \n\nand provided further that any limitation to \n\n(aa) a right entrenched in section ... 11 ...\n\n...\nshall, in addition to being reasonable as required in paragraph (a)(i), also be\nnecessary.  \n\nIn making the determination, especially with regard to a right as fundamental as the one\n\nin question, namely personal freedom, one really need not go beyond the test of\n\nreasonableness.  This is made all the clearer by the criteria for interpretation of the\n\nChapter 3 rights and limitations found in section 35 of the Constitution.  Section 35(1)\n\nprovides, inter alia:\n\n35. Interpretation. (1) In interpreting the provisions of this Chapter a court\nof law shall promote the values which underlie an open and democratic\nsociety based on freedom and equality ....\n\nsection 33(1), infra, validate the provisions vis-a-vis the right to freedom.  Section 10 provides - \u201c10. Human\ndignity. Every person shall have the right to respect for and protection of his or her dignity.\u201d  Section 25(3)\nprovides - \u201c(3) Every accused person shall have the right to a fair trial ....\u201d \n\n8\n\n\fKRIEGLER J\n\nClearly that provision applies to the interpretation of both the fundamental right\n\nprotected and the evaluation of any limitation according to the criteria of section 33(1). \n\nIn the case of the right and limitation at issue here such interpretation is perfectly\n\nsimple.  At the very least a law or action limiting the right to freedom must have a\n\nreasonable goal and the means for achieving that goal must also be reasonable.18\n\n[ 12 ]\n\nI accept that the goal of sections 65A to 65M of the Magistrates\u2019 Court Act is to\n\nprovide a mechanism for the enforcement of judgment debts.19  I also accept that such\n\ngoal is a legitimate and reasonable governmental objective.  The question though is\n\nwhether the means to achieve the goal are reasonable.  In my view, the answer is\n\nclearly in the negative.  \n\n[ 13 ]\n\nThe fundamental reason why the means are not reasonable is because the\n\nprovisions are overbroad.  The sanction of imprisonment is ostensibly aimed at the\n\ndebtor who will not pay.  But it is unreasonable in that it also strikes at those who \n\n18See S v Makwanyane and Another 1995(6) BCLR 665 (CC), 748A-B.\n\n19The Association of Law Societies argued as amicus curiae that the imprisonment option is defensible\nbecause putting some judgment debtors in prison coerces other debtors to pay their debts.  If indeed, this is the\npurpose of the law, then it would fail to be consistent with the Constitution because the goal of the statute would\nbe unreasonable.  For the purposes of this judgment, we do not accept this as the purpose of the law.\n\n9\n\n\fcannot pay and simply fail to prove this at a hearing often due to negative\n\ncircumstances created by the provisions themselves.  \n\nKRIEGLER J\n\n[ 14 ]\n\nThere are seven distinct reasons why the provisions are indefensible.  \n\n#\n\nFirst, they allow persons to be imprisoned without having actual notice of either\n\nthe original judgment or of the hearing.  It is not only theoretically possible but\n\nalso quite possible in practice that the debtor\u2019s first notice of the case against\n\nhim is when the warrant of committal is executed.  In terms of the procedure\n\npermitted by the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act and the Rules promulgated thereunder\n\nthere need not necessarily be personal service of any process prior to that.20\n\n#\n\nSecond, even if a person has notice of the hearing, he can be imprisoned without\n\nknowing of the possible defences available to him and accordingly without any\n\nattempt to advance any of them.  The so-called notice to show cause issued\n\npursuant to section 65A does  not spell out what the defences are, or how they\n\ncould be established.21\n\n#\n\nThird, the burden cast on the debtor with regard to inability to pay, although\n\npossibly defensible in principle as pertaining to matters peculiarly within his\n\n20Substituted service of some kind is possible in respect of all process prior to judgment.  See Rule 9 of\nthe Magistrates\u2019 Courts Rules.  Even where it was a default judgment, Section 65A(2) does no more than require\nthat a notice be given by registered post.  Section 65F(3)(b) renders unawareness of the original judgment a\ndefence, but that is cold comfort to the debtor who also has no knowledge of the hearing.\n\n21See Rule 45 and Form 40 of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Rules.\n\n10\n\n\fknowledge, is so widely couched that persons genuinely unable to pay are\n\nnevertheless struck.\n\nKRIEGLER J\n\n#\n\nFourth, the provisions of section 65F(3)(c), which spell out what the debtor\n\nmust prove, are not only unreasonably wide, but also unreasonably punitive. \n\nThe relevant part of the section reads as follows:\n\n(3) No ... sentence shall be imposed ... if the judgment debtor or ...\nproves to the satisfaction of the court\n...\n(c) that he has ... no means of satisfying the judgment debts and\ncosts either wholly or in part and that such lack of means is not\ndue to the fact that the judgment debtor\n\n(i) has wilfully disposed of his goods in order to defeat\nor delay payment of the judgment debt and costs; or\n(ii) although he is able to earn sufficient to satisfy the\njudgment debt and costs in instalments or otherwise to\npay such debt and costs, wilfully refuses to do so in order\nto evade or delay payment of the judgment debt and costs;\nor\n(iii) is squandering his money or is apparently living\nbeyond his means; or\n(iv) incurred debts other than for household requirements\nafter the judgment date.\n\nWhatever may be said about a debtor who wilfully frustrates payment\n\n(paragraphs (i) and (ii)) the nakedly punitive retribution inherent in the\n\nprovisions of paragraphs (iii) and (iv) cannot be justified.\n\n#\n\nFifth, the provisions allow a person to be imprisoned without knowing that he\n\nhas a burden to prove her or his defence or how to discharge such burden.  It\n\ncould possibly be contended that the magistrate ought to explain a debtor\u2019s\n\nrights and duties to an undefended layman and would probably do so.  But the\n\n11\n\n\ffact remains that there is no express obligation on the magistrate to do so.\n\nKRIEGLER J\n\n#\n\nIn the sixth instance it is hardly defensible to treat a civil judgment debtor more\n\nharshly than a criminal.  The latter is entitled in terms of section 25(3) of the\n\nConstitution to a fair trial with procedural safeguards, including the right to\n\nlegal assistance at public expense if justice so requires.  The debtors, who face\n\nmonths of imprisonment, must fend for themselves as best they can.  \n\n#\n\nLastly, the procedure makes no provision for recourse by the debtor to the\n\nmagistrate or higher authority once an order for committal has been made.22 \n\nSection 65L, which deals with the release of a debtor from prison, contains no\n\nmechanism whereby a debtor, even one against whom a committal order had\n\nbeen made in absentia, is entitled to approach a court for relief.  \n\nAs a result of these defects, the statute sweeps up those who cannot pay with those who\n\ncan but simply will not.  For this reason, the limitation cannot be justified as\n\nreasonable.\n\n22Admittedly section 65F(2) contemplates subsequent suspension of a committal order but there is no\n\nprocedure established for the debtor to enforce such right as the subsection may be said to afford him.\n\n12\n\n\f[ 15 ]\n\nThis conclusion obliges one to consider the question of severability.  Indeed,\n\nKRIEGLER J\n\nthere are two questions to be answered with regard to the possible severance of the\n\nprovisions of the law not consistent with the Constitution.  First, can one excise the\n\nprovisions which render the option of imprisonment unconsitutional because they do not\n\ndistinguish between those who can pay but will not from those who cannot pay?  If not,\n\ncan the provisions which provide for imprisonment itself be severed from the rest of\n\nthe system for enforcement of judgment debts?\n\n[ 16 ]\n\nAlthough severability in the context of constitutional law may often require\n\nspecial treatment, in the present case the trite test can properly be applied: if the good\n\nis not dependent on the bad and can be separated from it, one gives effect to the good\n\nthat remains after the separation if it still gives effect to the main objective of the\n\nstatute.23  The test has two parts: first, is it possible to sever the invalid provisions and\n\nsecond, if so, is what remains giving effect to the purpose of the legislative scheme? \n\n[ 17 ]\n\nIn the present instance, it is not possible to excise only those provisions of\n\nsections 65A to 65M of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act which fail to distinguish between\n\nthe two categories of debtors.  In order to do so this Court would have to engage in the\n\ndetails of law making, a constitutional activity given to the legislatures.  It is, however,\n\npossible to sever the provisions which make up the option of imprisonment.  The\n\nquestion then is whether in severing such provisions, the object of the statute will\n\nnevertheless remain to be carried out.  The answer to this question clearly is yes.  The\n\n23Johannesburg City Council v Chesterfield House 1952(3) SA 809 (AD), 822D-E.  See also, S v\n\nLasker 1991(1) SA 558 (CPD), 566.\n\n13\n\n\fKRIEGLER J\n\nobject of sections 65A to 65M of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act is to provide a system to\n\nassist in the collection of judgment debts.  Removing one of the options available under\n\nthe system does not render the system that remains contrary to the purpose of the\n\nlegislative scheme.  Accordingly, the infringing provisions can be severed and the\n\nbalance of the system can usefully remain in force.\n\n[ 18 ]\n\nIn the course of argument on behalf of the Association of Law Societies,24 it was\n\nsuggested that it would lead to a break down of the whole debt collection procedure\n\nunder the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act if the imprisonment option were to be struck down\n\nimmediately.  Therefore, so it was argued, this Court should exercise the powers vested\n\nin it by the proviso to section 98(5) of the Constitution so as to enable the legislature to\n\ndevise an adequate substitute.  I do not believe that the proposal should be entertained. \n\nFirst, it is by no means so that the system is dependent upon the imprisonment sanction\n\nfor its viability.  There are a number of other aids to judgment debt collection in the\n\nsystem, e.g., property attachment and garnishment of wages.  But even if I err in that\n\nregard the system is so clearly inconsistent with the right to freedom protected by\n\nsection 11(1) and so manifestly indefensible under section 33(1) of the Constitution that\n\nthere is no warrant for its retention, even temporarily.\n\n[ 19 ]\n\nIn the circumstances the following order issues:\n\n1.\n\nThe following provisions of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act are inconsistent with\n\n24Afforded an audience as amicus curiae by virtue of its special interest and expertise in the matter and\n\nrepresented by two members.\n\n14\n\n\fthe Constitution and are declared to be invalid with effect from the date of this\n\nKRIEGLER J\n\norder:\n\na.\n\nThe following words in section 65A(1)\n\n\u201cwhy he should not be committed for contempt of court and\u201d;\n\nb.\n\nc.\n\nd.\n\ne.\n\nSections 65F, 65G and 65H;\n\nParagraphs (a) and (c) of section 65J(1);\n\nParagraph b(ii) of section 65J(2);\n\nThe following words in paragraph (a) of section 65J(9)\n\n\u201c(a) or\u201d, \n\nand\n\n\u201cand may, subject to the provisions of section 65G, be committed for contempt\n\nof court for failing to comply with the said order\u201d;\n\nf.\n\ng.\n\nParagraph (b) of section 65J(9);\n\nThe following words in section 65K(2)\n\n\u201cor warrant for the committal of a judgment debtor or a director or an officer of\n\nany juristic person or of any sentence imposing a fine on any director or officer\n\nrepresenting a judgment debtor who is a juristic person\u201d; and\n\nh.\n\nSection 65L.\n\n2.\n\nAll other provisions of sections 65A to 65M of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act\n\nremain in force.\n\n3.\n\nWith effect from the date of this order, the committal or continuing\n\n15\n\n\fimprisonment of any judgment debtor in terms of section 65F or 65G of the\n\nMagistrates\u2019 Courts Act is invalid.\n\nKRIEGLER J\n\nJC Kriegler\n\nChaskalson P, Mahomed DP, Ackermann J, Madala J, and O\u2019Regan J concur in the judgment of\nKriegler J.\n\n16\n\n\f[ 20 ] DIDCOTT J: I am by no means convinced at present that it would be unconstitutional,\n\nDIDCOTT J\n\nonce certain conditions were met, for a debtor who had not paid the amount of a\n\njudgment duly awarded against him to be committed to prison for a limited spell like\n\nthe period allowed by our current legislation or, if the judgment was satisfied before it\n\nended, until the earlier date when that occurred.  The conditions which I envisage\n\nwould be ones requiring that: \n\n(a)\n\nthe creditor had already exhausted all other lawful means that were usable by \n\nhim for the execution of the judgment;\n\n(b)\n\nthe committal was preceded by a full enquiry into the reasons why the debtor\n\nhad  failed  to  pay  the amount  that  he owed,  an enquiry  attended by him\n\npersonally and conducted in compliance with the dictates of procedural fairness\n\nby the magistrate from whom the order for his imprisonment was sought;\n\n(c)\n\nat the enquiry the debtor had to explain the default, to disclose his financial state\n\nand affairs, and to submit to interrogation on those matters, lying largely as they\n\ndid within his own peculiar knowledge;\n\n(d)\n\nin the end, however, the creditor bore the onus to prove directly or inferentially,\n\nbut positively at all events, the debtor\u2019s ability in his particular circumstances\n\nto pay the amount owed and either a downright refusal by him to do so or the\n\nsheer wilfulness of his default;\n\n17\n\n\f(e)\n\nno order for the imprisonment of the debtor might ensue from the enquiry in the\n\nabsence of such proof.\n\nDIDCOTT J\n\nIn permitting the debtor to be consigned to gaol subject to those conditions, a statutory\n\nscheme of that sort would certainly deny him, throughout his sojourn there, the right to\n\npersonal freedom proclaimed by section 11(1) of the Constitution.  That section 33(1)\n\nauthorised the temporary denial of the right would be an arguable proposition all the\n\nsame, and no less so owing to the misdescription of the grounds for it when they were\n\nartificially called a contempt of court.  The denial might be viewed as a reasonable and\n\njustifiable measure, indeed as a necessary one, in a final effort to extract from a\n\npecunious but stubbornly defiant debtor the long awaited payment to which the creditor\n\nwas entitled.  And it might not negate the essential content of the right, were that\n\nconcept to be understood in the sense sometimes dubbed as objective which\n\nChaskalson P and Kentridge AJ discussed in S v Makwanyane and Another 1995(3) \n\nSA 391 (CC) (paragraphs 133 at 447C-G and 195 at 470F-471B).  I shall say nothing\n\nabout the wisdom, expediency or efficacy of such a scheme.  Nor, even on the narrower\n\nquestion of its constitutional validity, do I express a firm opinion.  That topic is beside\n\nthe point, since the scheme happens not to be the one we now have before us or, for that\n\nmatter, any other in actual operation here.  It has been postulated simply so that it may\n\nillustrate why I hesitate to generalise about the imprisonment of debtors, condemning\n\nthat out of hand and irrespective of the way in which it is regulated.\n\n[ 21 ]\n\nNor, in my opinion, do we need on this occasion to indulge in such\n\n18\n\n\fDIDCOTT J\n\ngeneralisations.  We can dispose satisfactorily of the issue which has been referred to\n\nus without resorting to them.  For the legislation that is under attack goes far beyond my\n\nimaginary scheme, doing so with no fewer than four draconian effects to which I shall\n\nconfine my attention.\n\n[ 22 ]\n\nThe legislation does not, in the first place, insist on the exhaustion by the\n\ncreditor  of his lesser remedies before he throws the book of prospective imprisonment\n\nat the debtor.  So much he may do a mere ten days after the judgment that remains\n\nunsatisfied was obtained by him, and without having taken or had the time to take any\n\nprior step in an endeavour to enforce it, by issuing a notice then which calls on the\n\ndebtor to show cause to a magistrate on a date announced in it, a date as early as seven\n\ndays later than the one when it was served, why the default should not be visited with\n\ncommittal to gaol.  The magistrate is not bound, when the appointed day arrives, to send\n\nthe debtor there.  Some other order may be made instead, an order for the attachment of\n\ndebts owed to him, or for a garnishee on his wages, or for execution to be levied\n\nagainst his property, or for the payability in instalments of the judgment debt.  No doubt\n\nthat is often done, at first anyhow, in practice and perhaps even as a matter of judicial\n\npolicy.  But it is not enjoined by the statute, which imposes no duty on the magistrate\n\neither to follow any of those other courses or to satisfy himself or herself that nothing\n\nwill be achieved by doing so.  Imprisonment is sanctioned as an initial alternative to\n\nthem, not solely as a sequel to their unsuccessful pursuit.\n\n[ 23 ]\n\nThe second harsh effect of the legislation is this.  It allows the debtor to be\n\n19\n\n\fDIDCOTT J\n\nimprisoned without a hearing.  The notice issued by the creditor, though served in\n\naccordance with the rules of court, may have been left with somebody else at one of the\n\nplaces permitted for its service and never have come to his personal attention.  He may\n\nindeed be unaware of the judgment itself, the same having happened to the earlier\n\nnotification of that which he was supposed to receive.  He may even have known\n\nnothing about the action instituted against him which culminated in the judgment, one\n\nobtained by default because the summons that started the litigation did not reach him\n\neither.  A series of accidents like those would be no surprising coincidence, after all, if \n\nthe same person had accepted service of all the documents in quick succession, but\n\nneglected to pass them onto him or knew not where he was.  Yet the statute expressly\n\nempowers the magistrate to sentence him to imprisonment in his absence, a fate never\n\nsuffered by convicted criminals.\n\n[ 24 ]\n\nAnother explanation for the absence of the debtor, even when he has received\n\nthe notice and the preceding documents, may be his ignorance of the various defences\n\nthat are available to him in answering it, in particular the important defence of a\n\npoverty afflicting him which is not attributable to his own improvidence.  He may\n\nlabour under the misapprehension that no excuse for his failure to satisfy the judgment\n\nwill be acceptable, that his imprisonment is an inescapable consequence of the default\n\nto which he must resign himself, and that his attendance at the proceedings cannot\n\ntherefore accomplish anything.  For the notice did not inform him of any such excuse.  It\n\nwas not required to do so.  That is the third obnoxious effect of the statute.\n\n20\n\n\f[ 25 ]\n\nThe fourth ugly feature of the legislation that will confront the debtor if he does\n\nDIDCOTT J\n\nappear before the magistrate, on the other hand, is the onus then resting on him to prove\n\nthat he cannot pay the judgment debt and bears no blame for his impecuniosity on\n\nvarious grounds which are listed.  He may not manage to establish that, although it is\n\nthe truth, especially when his very poverty has prevented him from hiring a lawyer and\n\nhe has to fend for himself in an unfamiliar environment, bewildered by procedures and\n\na forensic methodology to which he is a stranger.  The result may well be, the result\n\nmust often be, that someone who really cannot pay, through no fault of his own, goes to\n\ngaol for his failure to do so.\n\n[ 26 ]\n\nThe interests of creditors are plainly relevant to any constitutional appraisal of\n\nthe provisions with those effects.  Credit plays an important part in the modern\n\nmanagement of commerce.  The rights of creditors to recover the debts that are owed to\n\nthem should command our respect, and the enforcement of such rights is the legitimate\n\nbusiness of our law.  The granting of credit would otherwise be discouraged, with\n\nunfortunate consequences to society as a whole, including those poorer members who\n\ndepend on its support for a host of their ordinary requirements.  That does not mean,\n\nhowever, that the interests of creditors may be allowed to ride roughshod over the\n\nrights of debtors.  The legislation in question permits that most egregiously, I believe,\n\nin the four respects mentioned.  I am satisfied that it is unreasonable and unjustifiable\n\non those cumulatively oppressive scores.  Its clear invasion of the right to personal\n\nfreedom which section 11(1) guarantees to debtors like everyone else is therefore, in\n\nmy judgment, not countenanced by section 33(1).\n\n21\n\n\fDIDCOTT J\n\n[ 27 ]\n\nThe bad parts of the statute are not judicially severable, I consider, from the rest\n\nof its provisions that deal with imprisonment.  Their roots are entangled too tenaciously\n\nin the surrounding soil for a clean extraction to be feasible.  The conclusion to which I\n\naccordingly come is that we are left with no option but to declare those provisions as a\n\nwhole to be constitutionally invalid on account of their objectionable overbreadth.\n\n[ 28 ]\n\nThe incisive judgment prepared by Kriegler J in these two cases came to hand\n\nwhen the preceding parts of this one had already been written.  Its thrust, as I read it, is\n\nsubstantially the same as mine.  I agree entirely, I now add, with both the focus and \n\n22\n\n\fthe tenor of it.  For the reasons which Kriegler J and I have given, and for those reasons\n\nalone, I concur in the order proposed by him.\n\nDIDCOTT J\n\nJM Didcott\n\n23\n\n\fKENTRIDGE AJ\n\n[ 29 ] KENTRIDGE AJ:\n\n I concur in the judgment of Kriegler J and in the order which he\n\nproposes.  I also agree with the identification by Didcott J of aspects of the legislation\n\nwhich render it unreasonable and unjustifiable.  I would, however, in addition endorse\n\nthe general critique of the legislation set out in paragraphs [65] to [71] of the judgment\n\nof Sachs J.\n\nS Kentridge\n\n24\n\n\f[ 30 ] LANGA  J: The matter referred to the Court is the constitutionality of certain of the\n\nLANGA J\n\nprovisions of sections 65A to M of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act25  (the Act)  in so far as\n\nthey authorise the imprisonment of defaulting judgment debtors.  Inevitably, this raised\n\nthe question of whether the imprisonment of defaulting judgment debtors can ever be\n\njustifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality.  It is\n\nimportant to make a clear distinction between what has been decided and what has not\n\nbeen decided in this case.\n\n[ 31 ]\n\nThrough the judgments of Kriegler J and Didcott J the Court affirms that those\n\nprovisions that authorise the imprisonment of judgment debtors  in sections 65A - M of\n\nthe Act are unconstitutional and should therefore be struck down.   Sachs J arrives at\n\nthe same conclusion.  I am in respectful agreement with and therefore concur in the\n\norder proposed by Kriegler J.  That the relevant provisions are overbroad  was\n\ncommon cause to all the parties who argued the matter before us.  In addition,  it was\n\ncommon cause that the provisions were procedurally flawed.  Those procedural\n\nshortcomings have been crisply identified by Kriegler J at paragraph 14 of his\n\njudgment.\n\n[ 32 ]\n\nAs pointed out by Kriegler J26, the provisions hit two categories of defaulting\n\ndebtors, namely, those who wilfully refuse to settle their debts even though they have\n\nthe means and those who cannot pay because they do not have the means but who fail to\n\n25Act No. 32 of 1944 (as amended).\n\n26In paragraph 14 of his judgment, Kriegler J states: \u201cAs a result of these defects, the statute sweeps up\n\nthose who cannot pay with those who can but simply will not.\u201d\n\n25\n\n\fLANGA J\n\nprove their inability to pay.  Both categories are subject to civil imprisonment.   It is\n\nclear that it could never be constitutional to imprison a person who falls within the\n\nsecond category.  What is not settled however, is whether, provided certain conditions\n\nare fulfilled, it would be unconstitutional to commit a debtor of the first category to\n\nprison.   Because the impugned provisions are clearly overbroad and procedurally\n\nflawed, it is not necessary to address that question here.\n\n[ 33 ]\n\nAlthough I concur with the judgment of Kriegler J, I wish to add a few\n\ncomments concerning section 11(1) and its interpretation.  It is trite that imprisonment,\n\nwhether as a civil or criminal sanction, is a drastic curtailment of a person\u2019s liberty,\n\nwhich is the essence of the  \u201cfreedom and security\u201d provision in section 11(1) of the\n\nConstitution.  In the criminal law,  it is generally accepted that imprisonment should be\n\nresorted to only after the most anxious consideration.   Twenty years ago Hiemstra J\n\nremarked:27\n\nThe views of the Courts in regard to imprisonment have however undergone\nmodification in the last ten years.  Imprisonment is seen more and more as a harsh\nand drastic punishment to be reserved for callous and impenitent characters.  We\nwish to adopt a more enlightened approach in which the probable effect of\nincarceration upon the life of the accused person and those near to her is carefully\nweighed.\n\nThirion J, in a later judgment observed:28\n\n27In S v Benetti 1975(3) SA 603 (T) at 605G.\n\n28This was a dissenting judgment in S v Motsoesoana 1986(3) SA 350 (N) at 372F - G.  Thirion J was\n\ncomparing imprisonment with corporal punishment for juveniles as sentencing options.\n\n26\n\n\fLANGA J\n\nImprisonment is the form of punishment which may detrimentally affect not only\nthe offender but also his family and his employment and because of its duration it\ncan seldom be kept from becoming general public knowledge.  It ... can have a\nlasting demoralising effect on the character and personality of the offender.  The\nloss of liberty, tedium, regimentation  ... which prison life entails, have a greater\npotentiality than a whipping for destroying the offender\u2019s self-esteem and the\nintegrity of his character and for changing, for the worse, his way of life.\n\nReynolds J29 refers to the \u201c \u2018deleterious effects of penal institutions\u2019 ... and the\n\nunfortunate results that regularly follow the imposition of custodial punishment.\u201d \n\nGoldstone J30 refers to the need to  \u201c...  avoid exposure to the negative consequences of\n\nimprisonment\u201d.\n\n[ 34 ]\n\nThe language of section 11(1), which guarantees  \u201cfreedom and security of the\n\nperson\u201d and the right \u201cnot to be detained without trial,\u201d  is an implicit recognition and\n\nrejection of some of the practices of the past.   Despite the existence of common-law\n\nprovisions protecting personal freedom and security, many people were imprisoned\n\nand detained without the application of principles of procedural fairness and in\n\ncircumstances where they had committed no offence which would warrant the\n\ndeprivation of liberty.   Thousands of South Africans each year were, for instance, \n\nimprisoned for breaches of influx control legislation after summary trials which carried\n\nfew, if any, of the characteristics of a fair trial.   In addition,   imprisonment was also \n\nused to curtail other fundamental freedoms unjustly,   including  those of association,\n\nexpression and belief, and, as an instrument of coercion, in order to extract information\n\n29Reynold J\u2019s remarks, made in S v Chirara; S v Hwengwa; S v Pisaunga; S v Muzondiwa 1990(2)\nSACR 356 (ZH) at 358i - j, were in the context of a statement he quoted from by Ashworth in  Sentencing and\nPenal Policy (at 318) that \u201ccustodial sentences should be used as sparingly as possible\u201d.\n\n30In S v Kumalo 1984(4) SA 642 (W) at 644H.\n\n27\n\n\fto be used for prosecutions and various other official purposes.  It has therefore been a\n\npowerful weapon in the hands of  officialdom.  In terms of the challenged provisions,\n\nthis weapon is placed at the disposal of creditors for use against defaulting debtors.\n\nLANGA J\n\n[ 35 ]\n\nThe difference between the past and the present is that individual freedom and\n\nsecurity no longer fall to be protected solely through the vehicle of common law\n\nmaxims and presumptions which may be altered or repealed by statute,  but are now\n\nprotected by entrenched constitutional provisions which neither the legislature nor the\n\nexecutive may abridge.   It would accordingly be improper for us to hold constitutional\n\na system which, as Sachs J  has noted, confers on creditors the power to consign the\n\nperson of an impecunious debtor to prison at will and without the interposition at the\n\ncrucial time of a judicial officer.31  \n\n[ 36 ]\n\nFor the reasons articulated in Kriegler J\u2019s and Didcott J\u2019s judgments, I agree\n\nthat the impugned provisions constitute an unreasonable limitation on the \u201cfreedom and\n\nsecurity\u201d provision and that they are therefore clearly unconstitutional.   In view of the\n\nconclusion I have come to in concurrence with that of  Kriegler J,  it is not \n\n31Sachs J opines at paragraph 66 of his judgment that   \u201c[A] judgment debtor should in principle not be held\nliable through his or her person, life or liberty, for the payment of a debt, but only through the aggregate of his or\nher means.\u201d \n\n28\n\n\fnecessary to finally resolve the question of whether it would be unconstitutional to\n\nimprison wilfully defaulting debtors.\n\nLANGA J\n\nPN Langa\n\n29\n\n\f[ 37 ] SACHS J:\n\n Is imprisonment for debt in itself unconstitutional, or does it all depend\n\non how it is done and against whom it is directed?   This, to my mind, was the major\n\nissue raised in the present matter.  \n\nSACHS J\n\nIt was common cause amongst counsel for the Applicants and Respondents as well as\n\nthe representatives of the Association of Law Societies - although their reasons differed\n\n- that the imprisonment of judgment debtors in terms of the provisions of Sections 65A\n\nto 65M of the Magistrates' Courts Act, was unconstitutional. There was no agreement,\n\nhowever, as to the order which they thought should be made as a result. \n\n[ 38 ]\n\nMr Navsa, who was briefed by the Legal Resources Centre to appear on behalf\n\nof the Applicants, argued that the provisions in question flew in the face of the\n\ninternational prohibition against civil imprisonment, and were so profoundly ridden\n\nwith unconstitutionality, and so inextricably linked up with the remaining provisions of\n\nSections 65A to 65M, that the whole cluster had to be invalidated. \n\n[ 39 ]\n\nMr Potgieter, who appeared on behalf of the Government and the Minister of\n\nJustice, accepted that the unconstitutionality was broadly-based, but said that the\n\nprovisions dealing with imprisonment for alleged contempt of court could be excised\n\nwithout destroying the remaining portions. \n\n[ 40 ]\n\nMr Du Plessis, on the other hand, contended in the name of the Association of\n\nLaw Societies, that the unconstitutionality rested on narrow procedural grounds, more\n\n30\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nparticularly, on the lack of a hearing and a consequent violation of the well-known\n\nprinciple of audi alterem partem.  He argued that this defect could easily be corrected\n\nby the legislature if properly directed.  He agreed with Mr Navsa that the impugned\n\nprovisions were so intrinsic to the scheme of Sections 65A to 65M that the whole set\n\nshould be invalidated. In order to avoid a situation in which all court-supervised debt\n\ncollecting became toothless and ineffective, however, he urged us to require\n\nParliament, in the interests of justice and good government, to correct the defect in the\n\nlaw within a period of one year32; Sections 65A to 65M should then remain in force\n\nuntil such correction had been made or the year had elapsed.  In effect, he was arguing\n\nthat the scheme for imprisoning recalcitrant judgment debtors was rescuable, and\n\nshould be rescued. Implicit in the arguments of counsel for the Applicants and the\n\nGovernment, on the other hand, was the notion that the institution of sending non-paying\n\ndebtors to jail was intrinsically beyond repair and had to be ended forthwith.  It was\n\nthis disagreement that has prompted my exploration of the question of whether or not\n\nimprisonment for debt is in itself unconstitutional, or, whether, properly controlled and\n\nfocused, it could pass constitutional muster.\n\n[ 41 ]\n\nA perusal of the admirably, and I might say, enviably, succinct judgments of\n\nDidcott J and Kriegler J respectively, shows that they have not found it necessary to go\n\n32Using our powers in terms of Section 98 (5) of the Constitution, which provides that:\n\nIn  the  event  of  the  Constitutional  Court  finding  that  any  law  or  any  provision  thereof  is\ninconsistent with this Constitution, it shall declare such law or provision invalid to the extent\nof its inconsistency: Provided that the Constitutional Court may, in the interests of justice and\ngood government, require Parliament or any other competent authority, within a period specified\nby the Court, to correct the defect in the law or provision, which shall then remain in force\npending correction or the expiry of the period so specified.\n\n31\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nbeyond considering the reasonableness of the procedures involved.  I agree with their\n\nanalysis and with the order that Kriegler J proposes.  I feel however that a proper\n\nanswer to the request from the Association of Law Societies that we use our powers to\n\nkeep the committal proceedings alive pending rectification, requires a fuller analysis of\n\nthe institution of civil imprisonment than they have considered appropriate.  If there is\n\nnothing in principle constitutionally objectionable in sending people to jail for not\n\npaying their debts - as their judgments indicate or imply - then there would be\n\nconsiderable merit in the argument of the Association of Law Societies in favour of\n\nretaining committal proceedings pending rectification.  If, on the other hand, we are\n\ndealing with an institution that is intrinsically suspect then the justification for using our\n\npowers in terms of Section 98(5) becomes weak indeed.  The matter is of considerable\n\nimportance not only for creditors and debtors, but for the administration of justice,\n\ninasmuch as it affects the daily work of attorneys, magistrates and prison officers.  I\n\nwill accordingly complement the judgments of my colleagues with some views of my\n\nown.  I will start at the beginning, namely, with the nature of the right allegedly\n\ninfringed, and then proceed step by step until reaching the final question of whether or\n\nnot to keep the institution alive.\n\n32\n\n\fI   THE QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY\n\nSACHS J\n\n[ 42 ]\n\nThe first task is to decide whether Sections 65A to 65M are in whole or part\n\nunconstitutional.  In the present case, they were said to violate the right to freedom and\n\nsecurity of the person in Section 11, the prohibition against detention without trial in the\n\nsame section, the requirements of a fair trial specified in Section 25 and the right to\n\ndignity contained in Section 10. \n\n[ 43 ]\n\nSection 11(1) bears directly on the subject.  It reads:\n\nEvery person shall have the right to freedom and security of the person, which shall\ninclude the right not to be detained without trial.\n\nIt is tempting to regard the absence of a hearing as indicating that there is a direct\n\nviolation of the right in Section 11(1) not be detained without trial.  Given the specific\n\nmeaning that the phrase \u2018detention without trial\u2019 has acquired in South Africa, however,\n\nI prefer not to apply the words literally to the situation under discussion, but rather, for\n\nthe purposes of this case, to view them as protective buttresses for the broader structure\n\nof personal freedom.  I feel that this approach opens the way for a richer and more\n\nsophisticated exploration of the values embodied in the concept of personal freedom,\n\nwhich in turn will facilitate the discovery and delineation of what could be appropriate\n\nlimitations consistent with these values. It also maintains the relative impermeability of\n\nthe concept of detention without trial, as generally understood; the narrower and more\n\ndeeply anchored the right, and the closer it is kept to its special purpose, the more\n\n33\n\n\fSACHS J\n\neasily can it be defended against invasion.33   Similarly, rather than attempt to force the\n\nsituation of imprisoned judgment debtors into the matrix of a criminal trial, which has\n\ndifferent objectives34, I will regard Section 25 as a relevant background source which\n\nfurnishes values helpful in the interpretation of the elusive notion of freedom.  Thus,\n\nalthough Section 25 is not directly applicable to the present case in that defaulting civil\n\ndebtors are neither persons arrested nor accused persons as provided for in that\n\nsection, it does indicate fundamental standards of fairness regarded as appropriate\n\nbefore penalties, including imprisonment, are judicially imposed.  I propose, also, to\n\ntreat the right to dignity contained in Section 10 as a right which is intertwined with and\n\nhelps in the interpretation of  the rights of personal freedom and security protected by\n\nSection 1135, rather than as an independent right violated by the statute in question.  In\n\nthis way I will attempt to locate the issue in what I regard as its proper constitutional\n\nframework.\n\n33P Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada (3rd ed. 1992) at Chapter 4.\n\n34See Hicks  v  Feiock  485 US 624 (1988) where the US Supreme Court re-affirmed the distinction\nbetween imprisonment for a fixed period as a punishment for doing something forbidden, and imprisonment as\na flexible remedial instrument for failure to fulfil an obligation, with full due process being required for the\nformer, but not for the latter.\n\n35See comments on interacting values by Wilson J in R v Morgentaler 44 DLR (4th) 385 (1988) at 493;\nSee also S v Makwanyane 1995 (6) BCLR 665 (CC) per Chaskalson P at 702D and 722H-723A, and O\u2019Regan\nJ at 777E.\n\n34\n\n\fThe right to \u2018Freedom and security of the person\u2019\n\nSACHS J\n\n[ 44 ]\n\nMy principal focus is on the rights subsumed in the expression \u2018freedom and\n\nsecurity of the person\u2019.  The issue of determining the precise limits and content of these\n\nwords will no doubt exercise this Court for a long time to come.  Other jurisdictions\n\nhave battled with the problem of whether the phrase should be construed as referring to\n\none right with two facets, or two distinct, if conjoined, rights.36  Another\n\njurisprudentially controversial matter has been whether the words should be considered\n\nas applying only or mainly to the absence of physical constraint37 or whether it should\n\nbe regarded as having the widest amplitude38 and extend to all the rights and privileges\n\nlong recognized as central to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men and women.39 \n\nEven more fundamental (and even more difficult) are questions relating to the nature of\n\ncitizenship and civic responsibility in a modern industrial-administrative state, the\n\ndegree of regulation that is appropriate in contemporary economic and social life and\n\nthe extent to which freedom and personal security are achieved by protecting human\n\n36Hogg at 1022; Garant in  Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (2nd ed. 1989, eds Beaudoin and\nRatushny) at 334; Re Singh and Minister of Employment and Immigration 17 DLR (4th) 422 (1985) per Wilson\nJ  at  458;  R  v  Morgentaler,  supra.

This is the\n\nnub of the problem before us.\n\n[ 45 ]\n\nYet the second, and for our purposes, crucial step of the investigation, is by no\n\nmeans unrelated to the first.  Although notionally the court proceeds in two distinct\n\nanalytical stages,41 there is clearly a relationship between the two curial enquiries.  The\n\nmore profound the interest being protected, and the graver the violation, the more\n\nstringent the scrutiny;  at the end of the day, the court must decide whether, bearing in\n\nmind the nature and intensity of the interest to be protected and the degree to which and\n\nthe manner in which it is infringed, the limitation is permissible.  The President of this\n\nCourt has outlined the basic balancing process in the following words: \n\nThe limitation of constitutional rights for a purpose that is reasonable and necessary\nin a democratic society involves the weighing up of competing values, and\nultimately an assessment based on proportionality.  This is implicit in the provisions\nof Section 33(1).  The fact that different rights have different implications for\n\n40There is extensive literature on the subject which we are not compelled to explore in the present case.\n\n41S v Zuma and Others 1995 (4) BCLR 401 (SA) and S v Makwanyane and Another 1995 (6) BCLR\n\n665 (CC).\n\n36\n\n\fSACHS J\n\ndemocracy, and in the case of our Constitution for \u201can open and democratic society\nbased on freedom and equality\u201d, means that there is no absolute standard which can\nbe laid down for determining reasonableness and necessity.  Principles can be\nestablished, but the application of those principles to particular circumstances can\nonly be done on a case by case basis.  This is inherent in the requirement of\nproportionality, which calls for the balancing of different interests.  In the balancing\nprocess, the relevant considerations will include the nature of the right that is\nlimited, and its importance to an open and democratic society based on freedom and\nequality; the purpose for which the right is limited and the importance of that\npurpose to such a society; the extent of the limitation, its efficacy, and particularly\nwhere the limitation has to be necessary, whether the desired ends could reasonably\nbe achieved through other means less damaging to the right in question.  In the\nprocess regard must be had to provisions of Section 33(1), and the underlying\nvalues of the Constitution, bearing in mind that, as a Canadian Judge has said, \u201cthe\nrole of the Court is not to second-guess the wisdom of policy choices made by\nlegislators.\u201d42\n\nIf I might put a personal gloss on these words, the actual manner in which they were\n\napplied in Makwanyane (the Capital Punishment case) shows that the two phases are\n\nstrongly interlinked in several respects:  firstly, by overt proportionality with regards to\n\nmeans, secondly by underlying philosophy relating to values and thirdly by a general\n\ncontextual sensitivity in respect of the circumstances in which the legal issues present\n\nthemselves. \n\n[ 46 ]\n\nI make these points because of what I regard as a tendency by counsel,\n\nmanifested in this case,  to argue the two-stage process in a rather mechanical and\n\nsequentially divided way without paying sufficient attention to the commonalities that\n\nrun through the two stages.  In my view, faithfulness to the Constitution is best achieved\n\nby locating the two-stage balancing process within a holistic, value-based and case-\n\noriented  framework.43  The values that must suffuse the whole process are derived\n\n42Per Chaskalson P in Makwanyane supra at 708D-G.\n\n43See the warning Dickson CJC gives against a mechanical, formula-driven application of the principles\nin R v Oakes 26 DLR (4th) 200 (1986), and of his emphasis on the concept of a free and democratic society\n\n37\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nfrom the concept of an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality,\n\nseveral times referred to in the Constitution.  The notion of an open and democratic\n\nsociety is thus not merely aspirational or decorative,44 it is normative, furnishing the\n\nmatrix of ideals within which we work, the source from which we derive the principles\n\nand rules we apply, and the final measure we use for testing the legitimacy of impugned\n\nnorms and conduct.  If I may be forgiven the excursion, it seems to me that it also\n\nfollows from the principles laid down in Makwanyane that we should not engage in\n\npurely formal or academic analyses, nor simply restrict ourselves to ad hoc technicism,\n\nbut rather focus on what has been called the synergetic relation between the values\n\nunderlying the guarantees of fundamental rights and the circumstances of the particular\n\ncase.45  There is no legal yardstick for achieving this.46  In the end, we will frequently\n\nwhich, in his words, is the commonality which links the guarantee of rights and freedoms to their limitation.  R\nv Keegstra 3 CRR (2d) 193 (1990).\n\n44In the words of Dickson CJC, in Keegstra supra, they are no mere \u2018incantation\u2019, rather, they are central\nto the methodology to be adopted.  In the circumstances of the evolution of South African society as alluded to\nin the Epilogue to the Constitution, they could have special technical relevance in at least three respects:  our\njurisprudence has many admirable features, but has not always evolved in the direction of supporting openness and\ndemocracy,  hence  the  need  for  selective  utilization  of  decisions  by  our  courts;  the  deference  which  courts\nnormally give to \u2018political acts\u2019 and to legislative outcomes of the democratic process, might be more tenuous\nin the case of decisions and legislation of the pre-democratic period; and we might be required to use a wider range\nof source material than traditionally has been the case.  None of these issues have been argued before us, and none\nneed to be decided for the purposes of the present case, so I express no opinion on them.\n\n45By Dickson CJC in Keegstra  supra at 30 where he points out that factual circumstances shape the\ncourts\u2019 view of both the right or freedom at stake and the limit proposed by the state, neither of which should be\nviewed in abstract, and cites with approval the following statement by Wilson J in Edmonton Journal v Alberta\nAG 45 CRR 1 (1989) at 26-27. \n\n... a particular right or freedom may have a different value depending on the context.  It may be,\nfor example, that freedom of expression has greater value in a political context than it does in\nthe context of disclosure of the details of a matrimonial dispute.  The contextual approach\nattempts to bring into sharp relief the aspects of any values in competition with it.  It seems to\nbe more sensitive to the reality of the dilemma posed by the particular facts and therefore more\nconducive to finding a fair and just compromise between the two competing values ....\n\nand the observation of La Forest J in United States of America v Cotroni 42 CRR 101 (1989) at 117 that:\n\n38\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nbe unable to escape making difficult value judgments, where, in the words of\n\nMcLachlin J, logic and precedent are of limited assistance.  As she points out,47 what\n\nmust be determinative in the end is the court\u2019s judgment, based on an understanding of\n\nthe values our society is being built on and the interests at stake in the particular case;\n\nthis is a judgment that cannot be made in the abstract, and, rather  than speak of values\n\nas Platonic ideals,48  the judge must situate the analysis in the facts of the particular\n\ncase, weighing the different values represented in that context.  In the present matter\n\nthen, we are called upon to exercise what I would call a structured and disciplined\n\nvalue judgment, taking account of all the competing considerations that arise in the\n\ncircumstances of the present case, as to whether in the open and democratic society\n\nbased on freedom and equality contemplated by the Constitution, it is\n\nlegitimate/acceptable/appropriate to continue to send defaulting judgment debtors to\n\njail in terms of the procedures set out in Section 65 of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act.\n\nIn the performance of the balancing task ... a mechanistic approach must be avoided.  While the\nrights guaranteed by the Charter must be given priority in the equation, the underlying values\nmust be sensitively weighted in a particular context against other values of a free and democratic\nsociety sought to be promoted by the legislature. \n\n46Per Gubbay CJ of the Zimbabwean Supreme Court:\n\nThere is no legal yardstick, save that the quality of the reasonableness of the provision under\nattack is to be adjudged on whether it arbitrarily or excessively invades the enjoyment of the\nguaranteed right according to the standards of a society that has a proper respect for the rights\nand freedoms of the individual.  \n\nWoods and Others v Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs 1995 (1) BCLR 56 (ZS) at 59; 1995\n(1) SA 703 (ZS) at 706E.\n\n47Keegstra  supra at 109.  How difficult this judgment is, is brought out by the fact that, applying an\napproach cast in almost identical terms, the majority judgment given by Dickson CJC, supported by three judges,\nupheld the statute while McLachlin J, supported by two judges, would have struck it down.\n\n48 Trakman, Reasoning with the Charter (1991) at 201:\n\nRights are not self-explanatory.  They are principled constructions informed by social history,\ncommunicative experience and normative practice.\n\n39\n\n\fThe Limitations Clause\n\nSACHS J\n\n[ 47 ]\n\nSection 33, commonly known as the Limitations Clause, is central to our\n\nenquiry and bears repeating:\n\n33 (1) The rights entrenched in the Chapter may be limited by law of general\napplication, provided that such limitation -\n\n(a)\n\nshall be permissible only to the extent that it is -\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\nreasonable; and\n\njustifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom\nand equality; and\n\n(b)\n\nshall not negate the essential content of the right in question, \n\nand provided further that any limitation to -\n\n(aa)\n\na right entrenched in section ... 11 ...\n\nshall, in addition to being reasonable as required in paragraph (a)(i), also be\nnecessary.\n\n[ 48 ]\n\nThere are in fact a multiplicity of situations where the limitations clause might\n\nbe invoked to justify physical restrictions on personal freedom.  They were not argued\n\nbefore us and it would be inappropriate to express any opinion whatsoever on the\n\nvalidity of other proceedings presently treated by the law as permissible.  They would\n\ninclude such matters as:  detention of illegal immigrants, segregation of persons with\n\nhighly infectious diseases, custodial orders in terms of mental health legislation, and\n\narrests to establish or confirm jurisdiction of a person seeking to flee the country so as\n\n40\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nto avoid civil liability.49  In each case, the law limiting the exercise of the rights\n\ncontained in Section 11 would have to pass the tests of reasonableness, justifiability\n\nand necessity laid down in Section 33.50  I will not touch the complex question of not\n\nnegating the essential content of the right.  Many jurisdictions, our own included, allow\n\nimprisonment of persons who fail to meet court-ordered maintenance payments.51  Here,\n\ntoo, we are not called upon to give any ruling.  Nor are we called upon to make a ruling\n\non other statutes which impose criminal liability for failure to pay monies owing.52 \n\nWhat we are required to decide is the narrow question of whether the Sections 65A to\n\n65M procedures for the committal of non-paying judgment debtors to prison for up to\n\nninety days are constitutionally permissible; more particularly do they meet the Section\n\n33 criteria?  Put in summary form, Section 33 requires us to ask: is the limitation\n\nreasonable, is it justifiable and is it necessary?\n\n[ 49 ]\n\nThe tests of reasonableness, justifiability and necessity are not identical, and in\n\n49In terms of Section 16(1) of the Aliens Control Act 96 of 1991 and Section 33(1)(c) and (m) of  the\nHealth Act 63 of 1977 as amended (keeping under medical surveillance and restriction of movement of persons\nwith communicable diseases); Sections 16(1) and 19(1)(a) of the Mental Health Act 18 of 1973 as amended;\nSection 30 of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act 32 of 1944 as amended provides for the arrest of persons tanquam\nsuspectus de fuga.  See also African Realty Trust v Sherman 1907 TH 34 quoted in Jones and Buckle, The Civil\nPractice of the Magistrate\u2019s Courts in South Africa (8th ed. 1988) at 416.\n\n50In each matter, too, if litigation were to ensue, then, in my view, more than an ad hoc technical analysis\nof procedural fitness would be required if the correct order was to be made; sooner or later we will have to grapple\nwith the fundamental values underlying the rights set out in Chapter 3.\n\n51In terms of Sections 11(2)(a) and 14C of the Maintenance Act 23 of 1963 as amended.  Although there\nare some similarities with procedures under Sections 65A to 65M, there are great differences, and I wish to\nunderline that nothing in this judgment should be seen as impinging on these sections of the Maintenance Act,\nwhich was dealt with in argument only on the basis that it was clearly distinguishable. \n\n52For example, in terms of Section 25(2) of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act 3 of 1983 as\namended; Section 37 of the Wage Act 5 of 1957 as amended; Section 61(1) of the Unemployment Insurance Act\n30 of 1966 as amended; and Section 50 of the Manpower Training Act 56 of 1981 as amended.\n\n41\n\n\fSACHS J\n\napplying each one individually we will not always get the same results.  Frequently,\n\nhowever, it is convenient to look at and assess them together.53  Normally, if a\n\nlimitation fails to pass the test of reasonableness, there is no need to consider whether\n\nit could be justified or regarded as necessary; it falls at the first hurdle.  My colleagues\n\nhave demonstrated convincingly that on the assumption that sending defiant judgment\n\ndebtors to jail was a legitimate objective, present procedures are manifestly overbroad\n\nin furthering that purpose, and as such are unreasonable and unconstitutional.  As I have\n\nsaid, I agree with them.  In the present case,  however, we are required to do more than\n\ndecide on the constitutionality of certain statutory provisions.  We are asked to use our\n\ndiscretion in terms of Section 98(5) to keep constitutionally invalid provisions alive. \n\nIn concrete terms, I consider this to be the real issue before us.  In making our\n\nassessment, I accordingly feel it is appropriate to examine whether, even if the\n\nprocedural defects could be cured, as Mr Du Plessis argued, the limitation would pass\n\nthe tests of justifiability and necessity.  If committal proceedings are in essence both\n\njustifiable and necessary, but vitiated merely because the means used are unreasonable\n\nin relation to the objective to be achieved, the case for giving Parliament a chance to\n\nremedy the defect is a strong one.   If, however, they would fail the tests of justifiability\n\nand necessity, however well tailored, then there would be no point in attempting to\n\ncorrect the procedures.  I will accordingly deal with the distinct criteria both separately\n\nand globally.\n\n\u2018Reasonableness\u2019\n\n53See Kentridge AJ in Zuma supra at 420A-B.\n\n42\n\n\f[ 50 ]\n\nThe requirement that limitation be reasonable presupposes more than the\n\nSACHS J\n\nexistence of a rational connection between the purpose to be served and the invasion of\n\nthe right.  Thus, a limitation logically connected to its objective could be unreasonable\n\nif it undermined a long established and now entrenched right;54 imposed a penalty that\n\nwas arbitrary, unfair or irrational;55 or, as in this case, used means that were\n\nunreasonable.56  My colleagues have dealt in detail with this aspect, and I need say no\n\nmore than that the procedures are manifestly unreasonable.\n\n\u2018Justifiable in an Open and Democratic Society\u2019\n\n[ 51 ]\n\nIn deciding whether or not sending people to jail for not paying their debts is\n\njustifiable in an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality, we need\n\nto locate ourselves in the mainstream of international democratic practice.\n\n[ 52 ]\n\nAt first sight, it would appear that imprisonment for debt is totally prohibited in\n\ninternational law and practice.  Paul Sieghart writes in a much-quoted passage that:\n\nIn the international instruments there are ... some exceptions of choice such as the\nfreedoms from torture, slavery and imprisonment for debt, which are declared\nabsolutely, without restriction or limitation of any kind, and not subject to\nderogation even in the most extreme circumstances.57\n\n54Zuma supra at 420A.\n\n55Makwanyane supra at 709E.\n\n56S v Williams and Others 1995 (7) BCLR 861 (CC) at 880C.\n\n57Sieghart supra at 87, note 1.\n\n43\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nWithout further analysis, however this statement might be misleading.  The point the\n\nauthor is making is that, like torture and slavery, imprisonment for debt is one of the\n\nprohibited practices in relation to which no derogation is permissible.  The question\n\nthat still has to be determined is exactly what is meant by imprisonment for debt; in\n\nother words, the concept or definition of imprisonment for debt can be qualified, even\n\nif its practice is absolutely forbidden.  A close look at international instruments shows\n\nthat far from resolving the dilemma posed in the opening sentence of this judgment, they\n\nreplicate it.  Thus, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man provides\n\nin broad terms that:  \n\nXXV.  No person may be deprived of liberty for non-fulfilment of obligations of a\npurely civil character.  \n\nThe American Convention on Human Rights similarly states in Article. 7(7) that:\n\nno one shall be detained for debt.  This principle shall not limit the order of a\ncompetent judicial authority issued for non-fulfilment of duties of support.\n\n[ 53 ]\n\nOn the other hand, the prohibition in the UN International Covenant on Civil and\n\nPolitical Rights (ICCPR), which is repeated verbatim in Protocol 4 of the European\n\nConvention, is somewhat narrower.  It reads:  \n\n11.  No one shall be imprisoned merely on the ground of inability to fulfil a\ncontractual obligation. \n\n44\n\n\fAccording to the Explanatory Report on the Fourth Protocol to European Convention,58\n\nfreedom from civil imprisonment must be understood in the following context:\n\nSACHS J\n\n[T]he obligation concerned must arise out of contract; the prohibition does not\napply to obligations arising from legislation in public or private law.  Nor does the\nprohibition apply if the debtor acts with malicious or fraudulent intent; or if a\nperson deliberately refuses to fulfil an obligation, irrespective of his reasons\ntherefor, nor if his inability to meet a commitment is due to negligence.  In these\ncircumstances, the failure to fulfil a contractual obligation may legitimately\nconstitute a criminal offence.\n\nThe aim of the Protocol was said to be to prohibit, as contrary to the concept of human\n\nliberty and dignity, any deprivation of liberty for the sole reason that the individual had\n\nnot the material means to fulfil his or her material obligations.59  Similar points are\n\nmade in connection with the ambit of Article 11 of the ICCPR, where it is stressed that\n\nthe prohibition relates expressly to contractual obligations;  that it does not cover\n\ndeprivations of liberty based on non-fulfilment of statutory obligations, nor does it\n\ninclude criminal offences related to civil law debts, nor does it protect persons who\n\n58Sieghart supra at 159.\n\n59See decision of the European Commission of Human Rights in the case of X v the Federal Republic\nof Germany, Case No 6699/74, given on 18 December 1971, where it was held that a provision in the German\nCode of Civil Procedure permitting imprisonment for up to 6 months (at the creditor\u2019s expense) of debtors who\nrefused to make an affidavit of means, did not violate Protocol 4.  The question of onus of proof in relation to\nability to pay was the central issue in the more recent case in the US Supreme Court of Hicks v Feiock supra which\nconcerned imprisonment of a father for failure to pay maintenance.   All members of the court agreed that if the\nproceedings were civil rather than criminal, then the 14th Amendment due process requirement of proof beyond\nreasonable doubt of ability to pay would not apply, and a legislative presumption of ability to pay would not be\nunconstitutional.  The court divided on whether the proceedings in question were shown to be civil.  The court,\nhowever, re-affirmed a long-standing distinction between imprisonment as a punishment for a limited period\n(criminal contempt), and purgeable imprisonment for remedial purposes to compel performance of an obligation\n(civil contempt), where the person concerned \u2018carried the keys of the prison in their own pockets\u2019.  The leading\ncases cited, however, dealt with refusing to produce documents, and refusing to testify under a grant of immunity,\nand not with failure to pay a contractual debt.  The case itself turned on failure to pay maintenance, where the\nobligation arose from law, not contract, and where the need to protect the interests of children was particularly\ncompelling. \n\n45\n\n\fsimply refuse to honour a debt which they are able to pay.60\n\nSACHS J\n\n[ 54 ]\n\nThe only conclusion that I can draw from these materials is that international\n\ninstruments strongly repudiate the core element of the institution of civil imprisonment,\n\nnamely, the locking-up of people merely because they fail to pay contractual debts, but\n\nthat there is a penumbra relating to money payments in which imprisonment can be used\n\nin appropriately defined circumstances.\n\n'Necessary'\n\n[ 55 ]\n\nBy adding the requirement that limitations on Section 11 be not only reasonable\n\nand justifiable, but also necessary, the framers of the Constitution were emphasizing the\n\nstatus of Section 11 as one of the core provisions requiring special solicitude.  It would\n\nthus not be sufficient for defenders of a renovated set of committal proceedings to show\n\nthat they were reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society.  The use of\n\nprison would also have to be sustained on the grounds that it was necessary.  \n\n[ 56 ]\n\nThe element of necessity thus tightens up the scrutiny in respect of what would\n\nbe reasonable and justifiable.  It is a question of degree rather than of kind. \n\nInvestigation of alternatives becomes more important and the tolerance given to the\n\nlegislature in its choice of means to achieve \u2018reasonable\u2019 objectives is reduced.61  The\n\n60M Nowak, UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights -  CCPR Commentary  (1993) at 193-6. \n\n61See O\u2019Regan J in Makwanyane supra at 780E-F.\n\n46\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nburden of persuasion is a higher one, and the balance is tipped more sharply in favour\n\nof upholding the infringed rights.  Although this might not involve an onus of proof in\n\nthe sense that the term is used in criminal and civil trials,62 it does presuppose that at\n\nthe end of the day, and after having considered all argument and done its own\n\nintellectual research, the court must be satisfied that the limitation in fact meets the\n\nrequirements of Section 33.  Clearly, not every form of regulation or each impediment\n\nto the exercise of free choice would qualify as a violation of freedom. 63  Yet once there\n\nis a manifest infringement of the right, as in the case of civil imprisonment, such\n\ninvasion would have to satisfy the special test of being necessary.\n\n[ 57 ]\n\nHow are we to interpret the word \u2018necessary\u2019?  Section 35 invites us to have\n\nregard to international experience where applicable when seeking to interpret\n\nprovisions relating to fundamental rights.  As I understand it, this section requires us to\n\ngive due attention to such experience with a view to finding principles rather than to\n\nextracting rigid formulae, and to look for rationales rather than rules.  Because of its\n\nimportance and its relative novelty in South African jurisprudence, I will set out\n\nreferences to international instruments in some detail.  The phrase 'necessary in a\n\n62The  Canadian  Charter  speaks  of  a  limitation  having  to  be  \u2018demonstrably\u2019  justifiable.    There  is  no\nequivalent word in Section 33, in respect of which the phrase \u2018burden of persuasion\u2019 might be more apposite than\n\u2018onus of proof\u2019.   Even here, I would be reluctant to see the fundamental rights of citizens becoming too dependent\non how adroit or maladroit counsel happen to be.\n\n63See Wilson J's caution about regarding any tenuous restriction as a violation of liberty, in Thomson\nNewspapers v Canada [1990] 1 SCR 425 at 186.  Also, her remarks in Operation Dismantle Inc. v The Queen\n18 DLR (4th) 481 (1985) at 516-7.  See also  Garant supra at 352:\n\nCountless standards, provisions and measures which affect the security of individual citizens are\nestablished by public authorities. Would it be necessary to see in each case an interference with\nor a threat to the security of the individual or corporation?\n\n47\n\n\fSACHS J\n\ndemocratic society' appears frequently in the European Convention for the Protection of\n\nHuman Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.64  To determine whether a particular\n\nrestriction is necessary,  a number of guidelines have been developed which the\n\nEuropean Court summarized in Silver v United Kingdom65 as follows:\n\n(a) \n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nthe adjective 'necessary' is not synonymous with 'indispensable', neither has\nit the flexibility of such expressions as 'admissible', 'ordinary', \u2018useful\u2019,\n'reasonable' or 'desirable'.\n\nthe Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of\nappreciation in the matter of the imposition of restrictions, but it is for the\nCourt to give the final ruling on whether they are compatible with the\nConvention.\n\nthe phrase 'necessary in a democratic society' means that, to be compatible\nwith the Convention, the interference must, inter alia, correspond to a\n'pressing social need' and be 'proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued'.\n\nthose paragraphs of Article (sic) of the Convention which provide for an\nexception to a right to be guaranteed are to be narrowly interpreted.66\n\n[ 58 ]\n\nThe term 'necessary' is also used in the ICCPR in relation to permissible\n\n64European Convention, Articles 8 to 11 and Article 2 of Protocol No. 4.\n\n65(1983) 5 EHRR 347 at para. 97.\n\n66An important distinction to be borne in mind is that the European Convention does not have a general\nlimitations clause such as Section 33, but rather identifies permissible limitations on a clause by clause basis.  The\nnature of acceptable limitations is spelt out in each clause, which makes the object of the limitation relatively easy\nto identify, and the application of the proportionality test a comparatively straightforward exercise.  The concept\nof margin of appreciation also has a special meaning.  It goes beyond the legitimate tolerance normally granted\nto the legislature to decide on matters such as budgetary priorities and the due weight to be given to competing\nsocial, moral, political and economic claims.  It relates to an acknowledgment of the need to accommodate the\ncultural, philosophical and political diversity of the states accepting the court's jurisdiction.  Robertson and\nMerrills in  Human  Rights  in  Europe  (3rd  ed.  1993)  at  198-204  indicate  that  the  width  of  the  margin  of\nappreciation varies a good deal.  This is inevitable because situations, claims and justifications vary considerably.\nThe  margin  will  usually  be  broad  if  some  restriction  would  normally  be  expected,  or  if  the  case  presents  a\ncontroversial political, economic or social issue.  They point out that the cases are not always easy to reconcile,\nbut \u201cthe result is not so much an inconsistency in the Strasbourg jurisprudence, as a demonstration of a point which\nis fundamental to an understanding of the Convention, that decisions about human rights are not a technical\nexercise in interpreting texts, but judgments about political morality\u201d. \n\n48\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nlimitations on fundamental rights specified on an article by article basis.  This has been\n\ninterpreted to mean that a restriction is necessary only if it responds to a pressing\n\npublic and social need, pursues a legitimate aim and is proportionate to that aim. 67  It\n\nhas also been stated that the requirement of necessity implies that the restriction must be\n\nproportional in severity and intensity to the purpose being sought, and may not become\n\nthe rule.   Unlike the European Convention, the ICCPR does not relate the element of\n\nnecessity to a democratic society; accordingly, the relevant criterion for evaluating\n\nwhether interference is necessary is not a common, democratic minimum standard, but\n\nrather solely whether it was proportional in the given case.68\n\n[ 59 ]\n\nThe Siracusa Principles drawn up by a group of experts to guide the\n\ninterpretation of the limitations clauses in the ICCPR state that:\n\n10: Whenever a limitation is required in terms of the Covenant to be\n\u201cnecessary\u201d, this term implies that the limitation:\n\n(a)\n\nis based on one of the grounds justifying limitations\nrecognised by the relevant article of the Covenant,\n\n(b)\n\nresponds to a pressing public or social need, \n\n(c)  \n\npursues a legitimate aim, and\n\n(d)\n\nis proportionate to that aim.\n\nAny assessment as to the necessity of a limitation shall be made on\n\n67Cf Nowak supra at 211.  See also Chaskalson P in Makwanyane supra at 710G-711B citing the case\n\nof R v France (1993) 16 EHRR 1 and Langa J in Williams supra at 880F. \n\n68Nowak supra at 325; see also at 379 and 394 where he states that the principle of proportionality\n\nrequires a precise balancing of the intensity of a measure with the specific reason for interference. \n\n49\n\n\fobjective considerations.69\n\nSACHS J\n\nCommenting on the general use of the word 'necessary' in international instruments,\n\nPaul Sieghart says that the principle of proportionality is inherent in the adjective\n\n'necessary'.  This means, amongst other things, that every 'formality', 'condition',\n\n'restriction', or 'penalty' imposed must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.70  \n\n[ 60 ]\n\nWhat all the above citations indicate is that the term \u2018necessary\u2019 is not made the\n\nsubject of  rigid definition, but rather is regarded as implying a series of inter-related\n\nelements in which central place is given to the proportionality of the means used to\n\nachieve a pressing and legitimate public purpose.  Turning to the South African\n\nConstitution, I will not attempt a full definition of the word 'necessary', but, bearing\n\ninternational experience in mind, make the following observations. The requirement\n\nthat the limitation should be not only reasonable but necessary would call for a high\n\ndegree of justification.  It would also reduce the margin of appreciation or discretion\n\nwhich might otherwise be allowed to Parliament.  Personal freedom would have to be\n\nregarded as a core value not lightly to be interfered with.  In particular, any physical\n\nrestraints imposed by  State coercion would have to be looked at very closely.   In lay\n\nlanguage, a strong case indeed would have to be made out in favour of a law which\n\nallowed people to be locked up other than through the pre-trial and trial procedures\n\nprovided for in Section 25.  Put more technically, it would not be enough that suitably\n\n69See (1985) 7 Human Rights Quarterly 1, quoted by Erasmus in Rights and Constitutionalism supra at\n\n644.\n\n70Sieghart supra at 94; on margin of appreciation at 99-102.\n\n50\n\n\fSACHS J\n\namended Sections 65A to 65M served the public interest in a rational way by enforcing\n\nlegitimate claims of creditors, and using justifiable methods before to do so. The public\n\ninterest served by these sections would have to be so pressing or compelling as clearly\n\nto outweigh the indignity and loss of freedom suffered by the judgment debtors, not to\n\nspeak of the costs to the public purse.  In negative terms, the law would not be\n\npermitted to impose restrictions or burdens going beyond what would be strictly\n\nrequired to meet the legitimate interests of judgment creditors and society as a whole. \n\nThis is not to say that an impossibly high threshold would have to be established which\n\neffectively ruled out genuine weighing by Parliament of reasonable alternatives within\n\nthe broad bracket of what would not be unduly oppressive in the circumstances.71  The\n\nrequirement of finding \u2018the least onerous solution\u2019 would not therefore have to be seen\n\nas imposing on the court a duty to weigh each and every alternative with a view to\n\ndetermining precisely which imposed the least burdens.  What would matter is that the\n\nmeans adopted by Parliament fell within the category of options which were clearly not\n\nunduly burdensome, overbroad or excessive, considering all the reasonable\n\nalternatives.  The question could would than have to be asked: could the societal\n\nreasons in favour of imprisonment of judgment \n\n71See the remarks of Wilson J in Re Singh supra at 467.\n\n51\n\n\fdebtors be said to be sufficiently acute and forceful to pierce the protective\n\nconstitutional armour provided by the word necessary?\n\nSACHS J\n\nCivil imprisonment or contempt of court?\n\n[ 61 ]\n\nOne justification of the necessity for retaining committal proceedings is that\n\nwhat we are really dealing with is not civil imprisonment at all but contempt of court. \n\nThis indeed is the descriptive justification given in the texts of Sections 65A to 65M\n\nthemselves for imprisonment of debtors in default.  The institution of contempt of court\n\nhas an ancient and honourable, if at times abused, history.  If we are truly dealing with\n\ncontempt of court then the need to keep the committal proceedings alive would be\n\nstrong, because the rule of law requires that the dignity and authority of the courts, as\n\nwell as their capacity to carry out their functions, should always be maintained.  Yet\n\nare we in truth dealing with contempt of court?  In answering this question it is useful to\n\nlook at the context in which Sections 65A to 65M were adopted and the manner in\n\nwhich they have been interpreted until now.72  Legal history shows that Sections 65A to\n\n65M are based on a confluence of two common law principles that were previously\n\nseparate and to some extent even in conflict with each other.  The first related to\n\nimprisonment for civil debt, which went back to Roman times;  the second was the\n\nconcept of contempt of court, in terms of which persons could be fined or committed to\n\nprison for challenging the dignity or authority of a court, usually because of defying a\n\n72The information on which the following observations are based was culled from the Report of the South\nAfrican Law Commission on Committal to Prison in Respect of Debt, May 1986.  The Report refers to such\ncommittal as an 'anomaly' and recommends that it be abolished.\n\n52\n\n\fSACHS J\n\ncourt order.  In respect of contempt of court, the common law drew a sharp distinction\n\nbetween orders ad solvendam pecuniam, which related to the payment of money, and\n\norders ad factum praestandum, which called upon a person to perform a certain act or\n\nrefrain from specified action.  Failure to comply with the order to pay money was not\n\nregarded as contempt of court, whereas disobedience of the latter order was.  Thus,\n\ncivil imprisonment for failure to pay a debt was a remedy in its own right, not\n\ndependent on proof of contempt of court.  Conversely, contempt of court proceedings\n\nwere not used against defaulting  judgment debtors.  \n\nThe purport of legislation adopted in the mid-1970's was to reverse the situation:  civil\n\nimprisonment as an institution was to be abolished, while failure to pay a judgment debt\n\nwas to give rise to liability to be imprisoned for contempt of court.  Sections 65A to\n\n65M, introduced into the Magistrates' Courts Act in 1976, authorized the committal to\n\nprison for contempt of court of debtors who had defaulted on judgment debts.  The\n\nAbolition of Civil Imprisonment Act 2 of 1977, on the other hand, purported to get rid\n\nof civil imprisonment, though it did keep alive committal proceedings in the\n\nMagistrates\u2019 Courts.73  Judges of the Supreme Court were, however, unconvinced either\n\nthat civil imprisonment had been abolished or that the real reason why debtors in the\n\nMagistrates\u2019 Courts were being committed to prison was for contempt of court. Looking\n\nat the legislative history, Van Dijkhorst J felt compelled to declare that \"die daad wat\n\nstrafbaar gestel word is ... die wanbetaling van die vonnisskuld\" (the act that is made\n\npunishable is the failure to pay judgment debt), and that in reality civil imprisonment\n\n73Section 3.\n\n53\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nwas re-introduced \"onder die dekmantel van minagting van die hof\" (under the cloak\n\nof contempt of court).74  In another case,75 the court commented that if regard was had to\n\nthe wording of Section 65A(1) and 65F(1) \"the so-called contempt of court is a failure\n\nto satisfy a civil judgment\".76  In both cases, the court observed that the sections\n\nconcerned made drastic inroads into the freedom of the individual and had accordingly\n\nto be interpreted restrictively rather than extensively.\n\n[ 62 ]\n\nThe mere fact that what the statute refers to as contempt of court could be\n\nconsidered civil imprisonment under another name, (a matter which will be discussed\n\nfurther below), would not, of course, per se make it unconstitutional.  Nor does the\n\njudicial characterization of the law as being one that makes severe inroads into the\n\nfreedom of the individual mean that such inroads could not be justified in terms of\n\nSection 33.  The function of this Court is limited to declaring unconstitutionality in\n\nrelation to matters properly brought before it, and then only where the legislation\n\nconcerned clearly resists being construed in a manner which would save it.77   This\n\n74Quentin's v Komane 1983 (2) SA 775 (T) at 778.  See also Grosskopf JA in T\u00f6dt v Ipser 1993 (3) SA\n\n577 (A) at 588 describing the whole process as being in effect one of civil imprisonment.\n\n75Van der Bergh v John Price Estates and Others 1987 (4) SA 58 (SE).\n\n76See also Knott v Tuck 1968 (2) SA 495 (D) at 496H; Hofmeyr v Fourie; BJBS Contractors (Pty) Ltd\n\nv Lategan 1975 (2) 590 (C) at 590-600; Erasmus v Thyssen 1994 (3) 797 (C).\n\n77Section 232(3) provides that if a restricted interpretation of the law concerned is possible, which would\nsave it from making unconstitutional inroads into fundamental rights, then such interpretation must be favoured,\neven if it went against the prima facie meaning of the words in question.  This section gives expression to the\nprinciple well known in other jurisdictions as \u2018reading down\u2019.  Hogg points out that reading down allows the bulk\nof the legislative policy to be accomplished, while trimming off those applications that are constitutionally bad.\nSee Hogg supra at 393-4. Like severance, it mitigates the impact of judicial review, but reading down achieves its\nremedial purpose solely by the interpretation of the challenged statute, whereas severance involves holding part\nof the statute to be invalid.  It is still primarily the task of Parliament, not this Court, to adapt the laws of the\ncountry to the new democratic and rights-based dispensation.\n\n54\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nlatter principle does not, of course, imply the opposite, namely that fundamental rights\n\nwould have to be narrowly interpreted in order to keep legislation alive.  Section 232\n\n(3) would permit a pared-down construction of legislation so as to rescue it from being\n\ndeclared invalid; it would not require a restricted interpretation of fundamental rights\n\nso as to interfere as little as possible with pre-existing law.78  Furthermore, it would\n\nnot be the function of the court to fill in lacunae79 in statutes that might not have been\n\nvisible or regarded as legally significant in the era when parliamentary legislation\n\ncould not be challenged, but which would become glaringly obvious in the age of\n\nconstitutional rights; the requirement of reading down would not be an authorization for\n\nreading in.\n\nCritiques of Sections 65A to 65M\n\n[ 63 ]\n\nMr Du Plessis contended on behalf of the Association of Law Societies that\n\nsave for one fatal defect, the procedures outlined in Sections 65A to 65M were not only\n\nnot unfair, but necessary to ensure that people paid their debts and that debt-collecting\n\nwas conducted in an orderly way and not through what he termed the law of the jungle.  \n\nThe essence of Mr Du Plessis\u2019 argument can be summed up as follows:  The threat of\n\ncommittal for a short period is not an inappropriate sanction for debtors who are able\n\nto pay, but refuse to do so.  Without some penalty of this kind, the whole of debt-\n\n78See Kentridge AJ in Zuma supra at 411E-G.\n\n79See Hunter et al v Southam Inc 11 DLR (4th) 641 (1984) per Dickson J (as he then was) at 659:\n\nIt  should  not  fall  to  the  courts  to  fill  in  the  details  that  will  render  legislative  lacunae\nconstitutional.\n\n55\n\n\fSACHS J\n\ncollecting can come to be regarded more as a matter of benign entreaty than of serious\n\nlaw enforcement.  Worse still, strong-arm methods of debt-collecting, far more\n\ndeleterious in the result than a period in prison, would inevitably follow.  Far from\n\nbeing over-severe, a well-focused process could be quite appropriate for the objective\n\nto be achieved, namely to separate out the reprobate from the unfortunate.  The correct\n\nbalance between the rights of creditors and debtors would be maintained.  The rule of\n\nlaw would be upheld.  Any limitation on personal freedom that might result would be\n\nthe consequence not of a harsh law, but of a conscious decision by the recalcitrant\n\ndebtor to defy the court order; it would not be too drastic in the circumstances; and it\n\nwould be under judicial control and function according to clearly prescribed criteria. It\n\nwas reasoning along these lines which underlay Mr Du Plessis\u2019 request, on behalf of\n\nthe Association of Law Societies, that we exercise our discretion to keep the current\n\ndebt-collecting procedure alive while Parliament remedied what he regarded as a\n\ntechnical and procedural defect in a well-tried, legitimate and socially-necessary legal\n\ninstitution.\n\n[ 64 ]\n\nAs far as counsel for the Applicants and the Government were concerned,\n\nhowever, the institution was intrinsically bad because it represented a continuation of\n\ncivil imprisonment, under another name.  In their view, it was profoundly violatory of\n\nfundamental rights in its application, and beyond repair by Parliament.  For the\n\npurposes of this judgment, it is not necessary to recapitulate all their arguments or to\n\nanalyse the supporting materials they made available to us.  Nor is this Court obliged to\n\nmake a definitive finding on whether or not the committal proceedings in Sections 65A\n\n56\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nto 65M are constitutionally retrievable or not.  Yet it is appropriate to examine Mr Du\n\nPlessis\u2019 arguments with some attention, since if I am convinced that his overall\n\nevaluation of the committal proceedings is correct, then I could be more easily\n\npersuaded than otherwise to accede to his request to give an order in terms of Section\n\n98(5) which would enable the committal proceedings to be rescued by Parliament.\n\n[ 65 ]\n\nIf we look at the text not in abstract, but in its actual legal-historical setting and\n\nsocio-economic context, and if we are sensitive both to its purpose and to its impact,80 \n\nwe find strong suggestions to the effect that it does indeed represent a form of civil\n\nimprisonment in disguise, retained as a relatively quick and inexpensive means of\n\nfrightening small debtors into paying up without following the procedures regarded as\n\nappropriate in the case of larger debtors.  In other words, the defects might be\n\nsymptomatic of a deeper unconstitutionality, so that even if each imperfect procedural\n\ndetail were to be corrected, we might still be left with an unconstitutional legal\n\ninstitution.  The picture of the operation of the provisions, as painted for us by all three\n\ncounsel, was that of an institutionalized and systematic instrument of debt collecting,\n\nrather than that of a badly-tailored, yet nevertheless individualized, back-up process to\n\ndeal with occasional recalcitrant and contumacious debtors; the difference between\n\ncounsel was that Mr Du Plessis, in the name of the Association of Law Societies,\n\nthought the system as such was necessary and justifiable, while counsel for the\n\nApplicants and the Government thought it was not.\n\n80See cases referred to in note 89 below.\n\n57\n\n\f[ 66 ]\n\nAs I have said, Sections 65A to 65M do indeed describe the penalty imposed\n\nSACHS J\n\non a defaulting debtor as being based on contempt of court, which is a well recognised\n\nlegal institution of manifest virtue if properly utilized.  Yet even in technical terms,\n\nthere must be doubts as to whether this description is accurate.  The proceedings lack\n\nthe essential elements of criminal contempt of court, in that the imposition and\n\ncontinuation of the penalty is dependent on the will of the judgment creditor and not the\n\ncourt (other than through imposing the sentence).81  It is also doubtful whether it\n\nproperly qualifies as civil contempt of court.  A judgment debtor should in principle not\n\nbe held liable through his or her person, life or liberty, for the payment of  a debt, but\n\nonly through the aggregate of his or her means. The long-standing distinction made in\n\ncommon law between orders ad pecuniam solvendam and those ad factum\n\npraestandum is therefore founded on logic and principle.82   Thus, whatever\n\nterminology may be used, we could well be dealing in reality with civil imprisonment\n\nand not with contempt of court.   The essence of civil imprisonment, even in its milder\n\nforms, has always been that the debtor pays with his or her body.  The Afrikaans word\n\ngyselaar (hostage) comes from the contract recognized in Roman Dutch law in terms of\n\nwhich a freeman pledged his person as suretyship for performance.  Behind its verbal\n\ndescription, the committal process embodied in Section 65A can be said still to amount\n\nin practice to a form of ransom which family and friends are forced to pay to secure the\n\nrelease of the debtor, the only two differences being that the period is limited to ninety\n\n81See, however, Jones and Buckle supra at 273, where the contrary position is argued.\n\n82Specific performance, which requires the person concerned to do or to refrain from doing an identified\nact (such as handing over a motor car or ceasing to molest someone) by its nature can only be carried out in a\nparticular way, whereas in the case of debt,  there are other means of ensuring compliance with the court order,\nand if these means fail because it is impossible for the debtor to perform, then there is no real contempt of court.\n\n58\n\n\fSACHS J\n\ndays, and that the State pays for maintenance rather than the creditor.83  Viewed\n\nhistorically, civil imprisonment can hardly be regarded as a tried and tested remedy\n\ndeeply rooted in progressive legal tradition and necessary in a democratic society. \n\nOver the centuries and decades, its ambit has been progressively restricted so that now\n\nall that is left of it is its attenuated existence in relation to debtors hauled before the\n\nMagistrates\u2019 Court; like the Cheshire cat, it has disappeared bit by bit leaving only, not\n\na smile, but a frown.  The broad question before us would be whether, in the open and\n\ndemocratic society contemplated by the Constitution, it could ever be appropriate to\n\nuse imprisonment as a means of  ensuring that creditors got paid in full, bearing in mind\n\nthat the amount to be collected would often fall below the costs of collection, not to\n\nspeak of the costs to the taxpayer of keeping the debtor in prison.84  It is evident from\n\nthe statistical data presented to us85  that committal to prison is in reality mainly for\n\nrelatively small amounts and largely for debt in respect of goods purchased, services\n\nrendered and money borrowed.  Mr Du Plessis argued that the expense to be\n\nconsidered would not be that of sending people to prison for trifling amounts, but rather\n\nthe cost of keeping the spectre of prison sufficiently alive and deterrent\n\n83Cf Hofmeyr v Fourie supra at 599-600.\n\n84This could have been a factor in producing the unusual situation where it was government that asked for\na simple striking down of the offensive portions of the statute, while the Association of Law Societies urged us\nto keep them alive pending rectification.\n\n85In the period 1977 to 1984 the number of civil summonses for debt issued each year rose from 587,000\np.a. to 666,000 p.a. while the number of committals increased sharply from 3,600 p.a. to 9,000 p. a.  A random\nsample showed that 37% of imprisoned debtors owed less than R100, and 83% less than R500.  On average, the\ndebtors were sentenced to 31 days each, and served 9 before being released.  The causes of debt were principally\ngoods purchased (62%), professional services - mainly to doctors and lawyers (12%), money borrowed (9%) and\nother services (8%).  Unfortunately, the detailed statistics made available to us were not up to date, but even\nallowing for inflation, the amounts involved would still be relatively trivial.  We were informed that the number\nof committals increased to approximately 18,000 p.a., or, as Mr Navsa put it, two every hour.  It appears, however,\nthat in 1994, when the new Constitution came into force, the number dropped sharply to 3,700 p.a..   See the\naffidavit of Johan Jacob Arno Botha submitted on behalf of the Association of Law Societies. \n\n59\n\n\fSACHS J\n\n(afskrikwekkend) to compel the great majority of debtors to pay up.  When properly\n\nexamined, however,  this argument seems to condemn rather than support the institution\n\nof committal proceedings, under Sections 65A to 65M.  The persons most vulnerable to\n\ncommittal orders would be precisely those who were unemployed, and thus could not\n\nbe subject to emoluments orders,86   and those who did not have any property which\n\ncould be attached.87  To penalize the workless and the poor so as to frighten those a\n\nlittle better off would be exactly the kind of instrumentalising of human beings which\n\nthe concept of  fundamental rights was designed to rebut.88  To suggest that thousands of\n\npeople would rather go to jail than satisfy relatively small debts within their capacity to\n\npay, strains the imagination.  There is thus support for Mr Navsa\u2019s claim that the object\n\nof the system would be to send to jail those who could not pay in order to get money out\n\nof those who could pay.  The borderline between ability to pay and refusal to pay\n\nwould be a shadowy one; resigned and bewildered debtors, confused by complicated\n\nand technical notices, would inevitably get caught up with the truly recalcitrant debt-\n\ndodgers who defiantly refused to pay even when they could.\n\n[ 67 ]\n\nFurthermore, even if the corrected law were to be overtly neutral in its\n\nlanguage, its operational effect would to a degree be discriminatory89 in that the rich\n\n86Section 65J.\n\n87Section 65E.\n\n88Chaskalson P in Makwanyane supra at 723A; Langa J in Williams at 886F-G.\n\n89Though judgment creditors in the superior courts can and do transfer judgment debts to the Magistrates\u2019\nCourts for enforcement in terms of section 65M, the statistics quoted indicate that the overwhelming majority\nof cases are for relatively small sums.  As Dickson CJC said in the Canadian case of Morgentaler supra at 408.\n\nAs is so often the case in matters of interpretation ... the straightforward reading of this statutory\n\n60\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nwho did not pay their debts would in practice be dealt with in the Supreme Court by\n\nbankruptcy procedures which respected due process, while the non-paying poor would\n\ncontinue to be faced with summary committal in the Magistrates\u2019 Court.  It seems\n\nstrange indeed that the lower courts, using attenuated procedures in relation to smaller\n\ndebtors less able to defend themselves, would have greater coercive powers than\n\nwould the superior courts using normal due process in relation to larger debtors, better\n\nable to assert their rights.90\n\n[ 68 ]\n\nFinally, we must take into account the fact that other efficacious remedies would\n\nbe available to judgment creditors.  It would not be easy to substantiate the existence of\n\nan imperative need to use committal orders. The civil law, in fact, would provide a\n\nseries of remedies for non-payment of contractual debts.  These would vary depending\n\non the nature of the contract:  repossession or holding on to goods in some cases,\n\nscheme is not fully revealing.  In order to understand the true nature and scope of (the section),\nit is necessary to investigate the practical operation of the provisions.\n\nSee also his observation in Thomson Newspapers supra at 241:\n\nThe courts ... cannot remain oblivious to the concrete, social, political and economic realities\nwithin which our system of constitutional rights and guarantees must operate. \n\nFor the need generally to look not only at the purpose of a statute but its effect, see Pentney in Canadian Charter\nof Rights and Freedoms supra at 32-34.  See also, White J's dissent in City of Mobile, Alabama v Bolden 446 US\n55 (1980) at 102 on the importance of looking at the totality of circumstances to ensure that the 'design and\nimpact' of a challenged legal scheme is appraised in the light of past and present reality, political and otherwise\nas discussed in L Tribe, American Constitutional Law (2nd ed. 1988)  at 1502 et seq.   The latest trend in the US\nSupreme Court has been the other way.  See the criticism by Tribe at 1502.\n\n90The fundamental problem would seem to be that if, as was pointed out by Ackermann J in Makwanyane\nsupra at 728G-729A, due process is almost impossible to achieve de maximis because of the severity of the\noutcome (capital punishment), it is equally difficult to accomplish de minimis (jail for collecting small debts),\nwhere the relative triviality of the interest involved is overwhelmed by the cumbersome machinery required for\nits protection, bearing in mind that jail is involved.  See comment by Jansen and Brand, Civil Imprisonment, Debt\nCollection and Section 65 of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act, Centre for Human Rights Occasional Papers, No 7,\n1995 at para 9.\n\n61\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nevictions from premises, cutting-off of services, attachment and sale of property and\n\ndeduction from wages in others.  Where the assets were insufficient to cover liabilities,\n\nbankruptcy proceedings could be instituted with a view both to recovering hidden\n\nassets and to ensuring appropriate distribution of what was available.  The specific\n\nremedies, other than imprisonment, which Sections 65A to 65M themselves would\n\nprovide, would include:  sale in execution of goods; attachment of debts due;\n\nemoluments orders and an order to pay in instalments.  Another section would provide\n\nfor what would amount to sequestration.91  Furthermore, creditors could arrange\n\ndifferent forms of security for debts, ranging from mortgages to pledges to sureties. \n\nRather than extend credit freely and then rely on the threat of imprisonment to ensure\n\nthat the debt is paid, persons could prudently calculate the risks they undertook, and\n\nthen depend on normal methods of securing payment where the means for such payment\n\nexisted.  This need not require their denying credit to the poor, but, rather, their treating\n\nthe poor with the same circumspection they would apply to the better-off.\n\n[ 69 ]\n\nFor the purposes of this judgment it is neither necessary nor desirable to make\n\ndefinitive findings on any of the above matters.  Suffice to say that the constitutional\n\nvice at the heart of the committal proceedings cannot be identified with total assurance\n\nas being limited merely to the failure to provide a hearing, nor in my view, simply to\n\nthe defects listed by Didcott J and Kriegler J.  There are weighty arguments in favour of\n\nconsidering the institution as being more profoundly vitiated.  \n\n91Section 74(1) of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act 32 of 1944 as amended provides for the appointment of\nan administrator of a debtor\u2019s estate where the debtor inter alia has insufficient assets capable of attachment to\nsatisfy a judgment or the debtor\u2019s financial obligations.\n\n62\n\n\f[ 70 ]\n\nHaving rejected the minimalist position of contended for by Mr Du Plessis,\n\nSACHS J\n\nhowever, I feel it equally necessary to refuse to accept the maximalist claims of Mr\n\nNavsa.  As I have stated above, the  answer to the problem of constitutionality cannot\n\nbe found in an abstract, either/or decision over whether the practice in the Magistrate\u2019s\n\nCourt can be defined as civil imprisonment and as such automatically fall to be rejected\n\nas unacceptable (argument for both the Applicants and the Government tended to be\n\nalong these lines).  Rather, it would depend on an evaluation of whether, in their actual\n\nsetting and operation, the provisions would involve concretely identifiable and\n\nconstitutionally-indefensible invasions of the right to personal freedom.  Looked at in\n\nrelation to the request by the Association of Law Societies, which does not relate to\n\nconstitutionality but to the appropriate order to be made, the issue presently before us is\n\nwhether the institution under consideration is in itself so non-problematic and worthy of\n\nbeing kept alive that we should exercise our discretion under Section 98(5) in favour of\n\nthis course.\n\n[ 71 ]\n\nMy conclusions, on this point, are as follows: when the Law Commission says\n\ncommittal of judgment debtors is an anomaly that cannot be justified and should be\n\nabolished; when it is common cause that there is a general international move away\n\nfrom imprisonment for civil debt, of which the present committal proceedings are an\n\nadapted relic; when such imprisonment has been abolished in South Africa, save for its\n\ncontested form as contempt of court in the Magistrate's Court; when the clauses\n\nconcerned have already been interpreted by the courts as restrictively as possible,\n\nwithout their constitutionally offensive core being eviscerated; when other tried and\n\n63\n\n\fSACHS J\n\ntested methods exist for recovery of debt from those in a position to pay; when the\n\nviolation of the fundamental right to personal freedom is manifest, and the procedures\n\nused must inevitably possess a summary character if they are to be economically\n\nworthwhile to the creditor, then the very institution of civil imprisonment, however it\n\nmay be described and however well directed its procedures might be, in itself must be\n\nregarded as highly questionable and not a compelling claimant for survival.\n\n[ 72 ]\n\nThis is not to say that there could never be circumstances which could justify\n\nthe use of the back-up of prison to ensure that court orders for payment of judgment\n\ndebts were obeyed in the same way as other orders.  We are not called upon to decide\n\nthis question at the moment, nor do we  have sufficient material before us to make a\n\ndefinitive finding.  The legislature, if it so chose, would be better placed than ourselves\n\nto do the requisite research, canvass opinions and receive information; it could give\n\nfull consideration to relevant, inter-related factors, such as the proper management of\n\ndebt collection, the way in which credit is extended, remedies for ensuring fulfilment of\n\nobligations and the proper  use of court time and prison facilities.  It could weigh up all\n\nthe competing considerations and take account of cost implications and the availability\n\nof court and prison officials.  If it chose to undertake such an investigation it would, in\n\nmy opinion, have to operate within the following framework:\n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)\n\nThe process should not permit the imprisonment of persons merely because they\nwere unable to pay their contractual debts;\n\nThe procedures adopted would have to be manifestly fair in all the\ncircumstances;\n\n64\n\n\f(iii)\n\nImprisonment, involving as it does a major infringement of the right to personal\nfreedom, would have to be the only reasonably available way of achieving the\nstated objectives.\n\nSACHS J\n\nII       THE APPROPRIATE ORDER\n\n[ 73 ]\n\nIn the light of the above evaluation of the use of committal proceedings for non-\n\npayment of judgment debts, I proceed to answer the question raised at the beginning of\n\nthis judgment, namely, whether or not this Court should use its powers in terms of\n\nSection 98(5) to keep such proceedings alive.  If my overall assessment is correct, then\n\nthe necessity for retaining what amounts to a sanitized form of civil imprisonment has\n\nnot been established.  There accordingly seems to be little reason for pressurizing\n\nParliament into considering these questions as a matter of priority, which use of Section\n\n98(5) powers would require it to do.  The Association of Law Societies did suggest a\n\ncourse of action which would result in the coming into existence of such a reason. They\n\nargued that the committal procedures were so bound up with and central to the\n\napplication of the remaining debt collecting provisions, that removing imprisonment\n\nand  the threat of prison would lead to the collapse of the entire system.  They\n\naccordingly urged us to strike down Sections 65A to 65M as a whole and, then, in\n\norder to avoid a chaotic situation  from arising in the entire area of debt-collection, to\n\nuse our powers in terms of Section 98(5) to put Parliament on terms to correct the\n\ndefects.  Committal proceedings would then continue, pending appropriate remedial\n\naction by Parliament.  \n\n65\n\n\fSACHS J\n\n[ 74 ]\n\nThis raised the question of severability, namely, whether the impugned\n\nprovisions could be excised from the rest of Sections 65A to 65M, or whether these\n\nsections must fall in their totality.  If we were to follow the proposal of the Association\n\nof Law Societies, (surprisingly, in this respect, supported by the Applicants), then no\n\ndebt-collecting procedures in the Magistrates\u2019 Court would remain, and the need to\n\nexercise our \u2018life-saving\u2019 discretion would indeed be great.\n\n[ 75 ]\n\nSeverability is an important concept in the context of the relations between this\n\ncourt and Parliament; like \u2018reading down\u2019, it is an instrument of judicial restraint which\n\nreduces the danger of producing an overbroad judicial reaction to overbroad\n\nlegislation.  I agree with Kriegler J\u2019s analysis of the matter, subject to one\n\nmethodological qualification I feel worth mentioning.  It is the following:  in deciding\n\nwhether the legislature would have enacted what survives on its own, we must take\n\naccount of the coming into force of the new Constitution in terms of which we receive\n\nour jurisdiction, and pay due regard to the values which it requires us to promote.  We\n\nmust, accordingly, posit a notional, contemporary Parliament dealing with the text in\n\nissue, paying attention both to the constitutional context and the moment in the country's\n\nhistory when the choice about severance is to be made.  It is in this context that we must\n\ndecide whether the good can be separated from the bad.  In the instant case, the\n\nexcisions which my colleague proposes would leave a statutory provision that in my\n\nview is linguistically sustainable, conceptually intact, functionally operational and\n\neconomically viable; I agree with them.\n\n66\n\n\f[ 76 ]\n\nHaving separated the good from the bad, would it then be in the interests of\n\nSACHS J\n\njustice and good government to keep the bad in existence to give it a chance to become\n\npart of the good?  The words \u2018in the interests of justice and good government\u2019 are\n\nwidely phrased and, in my view, it would not be appropriate, particularly at this early\n\nstage, to attempt a precise definition of their ambit.  They clearly indicate the existence\n\nof something substantially more than the mere inconvenience which will almost\n\ninvariably accompany any declaration of invalidity, but do not go so far as to require\n\nthe threat of total breakdown of government.  Within these wide parameters, the Court\n\nwill  have to make an assessment on a case-by-case basis as to whether more injustice\n\nwould flow from the legal vacuum created by rendering the statute invalid with\n\nimmediate effect, than would be the case if the measure were kept functional pending\n\nrectification.  No hard and fast rules can be applied.  In the present case,  we are\n\ndealing with one of the core values of the Constitution.  As I have endeavoured to show\n\nat some length, we cannot say with confidence that all that is needed to rectify the\n\ndefect in the sections concerned is a simple set of  technical amendments.  It is\n\nintolerable, once the unconstitutionality of imprisonment of judgment debtors has been\n\nestablished, that persons should continue to be detained under the impugned provisions. \n\nIt has not been established that ending committal proceedings will impair justice or\n\ninterfere with good government in any drastic or irreparable way.  The other remedies\n\nprovided for in Sections 65A to 65M remain available to creditors.   There is no\n\nreason why we should insist on a rapid decision by Parliament, one way or the other,\n\neither to accept the continuance of Sections 65A to 65M in their truncated form, or else\n\nto modify them in the light of the principles enunciated by this Court.  Many issues\n\n67\n\n\fSACHS J\n\nwhich were raised before us could be considered at the appropriate time in that forum,\n\nbasing itself on the kinds of broadly-based enquiry we are not in a position to\n\nundertake:  for example, whether or not the whole area should be decriminalized,92 or\n\nwhether a procedure should be developed in terms of which failure to attend a debt\n\nenquiry hearing,  or the deliberate concealment of assets, should be made criminal\n\noffences to be prosecuted in the ordinary way.93  Policy choices of this kind, provided\n\nthey are resolved within constitutional limits, belong to Parliament, not to this Court,\n\nand it would be invidious for us to pre-empt the issue by making an order keeping the\n\npresent system alive pending legislative modifications.  I accordingly do not think it\n\nright to accede to Mr Du Plessis\u2019 request, and for the reasons advanced above, agree\n\nfully with the order proposed by Kriegler J.\n\nAL Sachs\n\n92In the comment referred to in note 90,  Jansen and  Brand propose that the entire system be de-\ncriminalised; that the law concentrate on effective  means of attachment; and that simple and effective measures\nbe designed to extinguish debts that cannot realistically be paid. \n\n93See South African Law Commission Further Report of August 1994.\n\n68\n\n\fMOKGORO J\n\n[ 77 ] MOKGORO J:\n\nI have had the opportunity to read the judgments of Kriegler J,\n\nDidcott J, Langa J and Sachs J.
